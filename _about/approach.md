# Approach



## Roadmap

Everyone has their preferred mode of learning a new/existing subject, whether it be by trial and error, guided instruction, YouTube videos, or a little bit of everything.
Currently, the pedagogy of information systems/technology is still evolving along with its ecosystem. However, the foundations this subject is built upon, and the lifestyle necessary to absorb this knowledge is largely intact.
We still use concepts conceived during the early days of computer science from the 60's and 70's, it just has a different look these days. Also, learning information technology (or "programming" as most people understand it) has to be part of your life style to tolerate the sometimes mundane science.
There's a wealth of information, terminology, structures, and rules that only apply in this field. It has it's own ecosystem with very limited understanding/oversight. We are in the wild `westworld` era, and no one knows what is best for you.
