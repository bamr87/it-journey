### Educational Front Matter Elements for IT-Journey

- **Learning Objectives**: Clear statements of what IT skills and concepts the content teaches
- **Target Audience**: Skill level and background assumptions for learners
- **Educational Context**: How content fits within the broader IT education journey
- **Technical Requirements**: Specific technologies, tools, and prerequisites needed
- **Assessment Criteria**: How learning success will be measured and validated

## Core Development Principles

### Design for Failure (DFF)
- Always implement error handling and graceful degradation in generated code
- Include try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- Suggest redundancy and fallback mechanisms
- Add monitoring and logging capabilities where appropriate
- Consider edge cases and potential failure points

### Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Extract common functionality into reusable functions, components, or modules
- Suggest refactoring when duplicate code patterns are detected
- Create utility functions for repeated operations
- Use configuration files for repeated constants or settings
- Recommend template patterns for similar structures

### Keep It Simple (KIS)
- Prefer clear, readable code over clever optimizations
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Break complex functions into smaller, focused units
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions or over-engineering
- Choose well-established patterns over custom solutions

### Release Early and Often (REnO)
- Suggest incremental development approaches
- Recommend feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Focus on minimal viable implementations first
- Include versioning strategies in code suggestions
- Encourage continuous integration practices

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
- Prioritize core functionality over advanced features
- Suggest starting with basic implementations that can be enhanced later
- Focus on solving the primary user problem first
- Recommend iterative improvement approaches
- Avoid feature creep in initial implementations

### Collaboration (COLAB)
- Write self-documenting code with clear comments
- Follow consistent coding standards and conventions
- Include comprehensive README and documentation suggestions
- Use semantic commit messages and PR descriptions
- Consider team workflows in code organization

### AI-Powered Development (AIPD)
- Leverage AI tools effectively for code generation and review using front matter context
- Suggest AI-assisted testing and documentation approaches guided by educational objectives
- Recommend AI integration patterns for enhanced productivity in educational content creation
- Balance AI assistance with human oversight and pedagogical expertise
- Use AI for learning and skill development enhancement, guided by front matter teaching notes
- Ensure AI-generated content aligns with learning objectives and assessment criteria specified in front matter

## Technology-Specific Guidelines
