- Does it demonstrate real-world applications?
- Will it help build a portfolio?

## üìã README-First, README-Last Principle

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE**: Before and after EVERY development task, interaction, or request:

### üîç README-FIRST: Start with Documentation Review
Before beginning any work, **ALWAYS**:

1. **Locate the Relevant README.md**
   - Find the README.md in the current working directory
   - If none exists, check parent directories up to repository root
   - Identify all related README.md files that provide context

2. **Read and Understand Context**
   - Review the README.md to understand:
     - Purpose and scope of the directory/module
     - Existing features and capabilities
     - Current structure and organization
     - Dependencies and relationships
     - Known issues or limitations
     - Contribution guidelines

3. **Assess Documentation Gaps**
   - Identify what information is missing
   - Note what might be outdated
   - Recognize areas that need clarification
   - Detect broken links or references

### ‚úÖ README-LAST: Update Documentation After Changes
After completing any work, **ALWAYS**:

1. **Update the Relevant README.md**
   - Add new features, files, or capabilities
   - Update changed functionality or structure
   - Fix outdated information or broken links
   - Clarify confusing or incomplete sections
   - Update the `lastmod` date in frontmatter

2. **Document What Changed**
   - List new files or directories added
   - Explain new functionality or features
   - Update usage examples if behavior changed
   - Add troubleshooting info for issues encountered
   - Update dependency information

3. **Cross-Reference Related READMEs**
   - Update parent README if adding new subdirectories
   - Update child READMEs if parent context changed
   - Update sibling READMEs if relationships changed
   - Ensure bidirectional linking is maintained

4. **Verify Documentation Quality**
   - Check that all links work
   - Test code examples if provided
   - Ensure clarity and completeness
   - Maintain consistent style and formatting

### üîÑ The README-First, README-Last Cycle

graph TD
    A[Request Received] --> B[üìã README-FIRST]
    B --> C[Read relevant README.md]
    C --> D[Understand context]

    H --> I[Document changes]
    I --> J[Cross-reference related docs]
    J --> K[Verify quality]
    K --> L[Task Complete]
```

### üìù Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Adding a New File
```markdown
**Request**: "Create a new utility script for data validation"

**README-FIRST**:
1. Check ./scripts/README.md
2. Note existing scripts and their purposes
3. Identify naming conventions
4. Review dependencies and patterns

**Work**: Create data_validator.py

**README-LAST**:
1. Update ./scripts/README.md:
   - Add data_validator.py to file listing
   - Document its purpose and usage
   - Show example command
   - Update lastmod date
2. If creating new category, update parent README
```

#### Example 2: Fixing a Bug
```markdown
**Request**: "Fix the broken link checker in Guardian"

**README-FIRST**:
1. Read ./scripts/hyperlink-guardian/README.md
2. Understand current functionality
3. Note existing issues or limitations
4. Review configuration options

**Work**: Fix link validation logic

**README-LAST**:
1. Update ./scripts/hyperlink-guardian/README.md:
   - Note the bug fix in a changelog section
   - Update behavior description if changed
   - Add troubleshooting note if relevant
   - Update version number if applicable
2. Update root README if this was a critical fix
```

#### Example 3: Creating New Feature
```markdown
**Request**: "Add AI-powered code review feature"

**README-FIRST**:
1. Read root README.md and pages/_about/features/index.md
2. Understand existing features and structure
3. Note feature naming conventions
4. Review integration patterns

**Work**: Implement AI code review module

**README-LAST**:
1. Create ./features/ai-code-review/README.md with full documentation
2. Update ./features/README.md to list new feature
3. Update pages/_about/features/index.md with feature entry
4. Update root README.md if this is a major capability
5. Add links between all related READMEs
```

### üéØ Why README-First, README-Last?

**Benefits**:
- üìö **Continuous Documentation** - README always reflects current state
- üß≠ **Better Context** - Understanding before acting prevents mistakes
- üîó **Maintained Connections** - Cross-references stay current
- üìà **Evolution Tracking** - Changes are documented as they happen
- ü§ù **Team Alignment** - Everyone sees the same updated information
- üîç **Reduced Confusion** - No orphaned or undocumented code
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Knowledge Preservation** - Learning and decisions are captured

**Prevents**:
- ‚ùå Duplicate functionality (you'd see it in README first)
- ‚ùå Broken documentation (updated immediately after changes)
- ‚ùå Lost context (README provides the "why" and "how")
- ‚ùå Orphaned files (README lists all files with purposes)
- ‚ùå Confusion for contributors (README always current)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Non-Negotiable Rules

1. **NEVER skip README review** before starting work
2. **NEVER complete a task** without updating README
3. **ALWAYS create README.md** if one doesn't exist in a directory
4. **ALWAYS update `lastmod`** date when changing README
5. **ALWAYS test links** after updating README
6. **ALWAYS maintain bidirectional links** between related READMEs
