# Space Instructions for IT-Journey

These instructions provide comprehensive guidance for organizing workspaces and implementing path-based development principles optimized for VS Code Copilot assistance. They focus on creating clear, navigable project structures that enhance AI understanding and collaboration throughout the development process.

## ðŸ¤– VS Code Copilot Integration for Workspace Organization

### AI-Assisted Workspace Design

**When organizing workspaces with VS Code Copilot**:

1. **Project Structure Planning**: Use AI to generate optimal project layouts:
   ```markdown
   // Prompt: "Generate an optimal project structure for [project type] that:
   // - Follows IT-Journey organizational principles
   // - Supports educational content development
   // - Enables clear navigation and discovery
   // - Optimizes for VS Code Copilot understanding
   // - Includes proper documentation hierarchy
   // - Supports multi-platform development"
   ```

2. **Path-Based Development**: Leverage VS Code Copilot for:

## Path-Based Development Principles

### Core Organizational Philosophy

**Clear Path Structure**: Every file and directory should have a clear, logical path that reflects its purpose and relationship to other components.

**Educational Hierarchy**: Organize content to support learning progression and skill development, with clear paths from beginner to advanced concepts.

**AI-Optimized Structure**: Design project structure to maximize VS Code Copilot understanding and assistance capabilities.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Ensure organizational structure works across different operating systems and development environments.

### Directory Structure Standards

**Root Level Organization**:
```
it-journey/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/                 # GitHub-specific configuration and workflows
â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode/                 # VS Code workspace settings and extensions
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/                  # Static assets (images, CSS, JS)
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/                   # Jekyll content pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _about/             # Platform information and philosophy
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _posts/             # Blog posts and learning chronicles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _quests/            # Gamified learning experiences
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ _notes/             # Technical documentation and references
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _docs/              # Comprehensive technical documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                 # Automation and utility scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ test/                    # Testing files and validation
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # Project overview and navigation
```

**Content Organization Patterns**:
- **Chronological**: Date-based organization for time-sensitive content
- **Topical**: Subject-based organization for reference materials
- **Hierarchical**: Level-based organization for educational progression
- **Functional**: Purpose-based organization for development tools

### File Naming Conventions

**Content Files**:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md` for time-sensitive content
- `descriptive-name.md` for reference and documentation
- `README.md` for directory overviews and navigation
- `index.md` for section landing pages

**Configuration Files**:
- `.config.yml` for configuration settings
- `package.json` for Node.js dependencies
- `requirements.txt` for Python dependencies
- `Dockerfile` for containerization

**Script Files**:
- `script-name.py` for Python automation
- `script-name.sh` for shell automation
- `script-name.js` for Node.js utilities

### Cross-Reference Management

**Internal Linking**:
- Use relative paths for internal references
- Maintain consistent linking patterns
- Include descriptive link text
- Validate link integrity regularly

**External References**:
- Use absolute URLs for external resources
- Include link validation in CI/CD
- Maintain reference documentation
- Update links when resources change

**Documentation Hierarchy**:
- Parent-child relationships between documents
- Sibling relationships for related content
- Cross-domain connections for integrated learning
- Version control and change tracking
