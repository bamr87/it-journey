## 🎯 Session Summary

I walked the first window (5 of 8 quests) of the **Digital Artist → Level 0100 "Frontend & Containers" (Adventurer ⚔️)** slice as a learner, driving the sealed agentic **execute** engine evidence (`walk-evidence.json`) and reading every quest source in plan order. The slice splits cleanly into two personalities: a genuinely strong, dependency-linked **Docker Mastery** pair (container-fundamentals → docker-compose-orchestration) whose core teaching is verified end-to-end, and a weaker, unlinked **Frontend Forests** pair (frontend-docker, frontend) — both still `draft: true`, both carrying auto-seeded placeholder objectives, overlapping heavily in topic, and neither wired into the level's dependency graph. The side quest (jekyll-component-refactoring) is pedagogically sound with small fixable snags.

**Headline verdict: ⚠️ warn.** Average 61.0%, 4 warn + **1 fail** (`frontend-docker`, 33%, which breaks at nearly every executable step). The Docker sub-chain is close to ship-ready with two chapter-3 fixes each; the Frontend Forests quests need real editorial work — concrete Bootstrap snippets, honest prerequisites, and de-duplication — before a beginner could follow them successfully.

## 🗺️ The Journey

| # | Verdict | Quest | Score | One-line takeaway |
|---|:--:|---|--:|---|
| 1 | ⚠️ warn | Docker Container Fundamentals: Images to Registries | 77 | Core pull/build/run/cache workflow all verified; multi-stage example and "live reload" claim are the two soft spots. |
| 2 | ⚠️ warn | Docker Compose Orchestration: Multi-Container Apps | 62 | Ch. 1–2 fully verified (incl. a real volume-persistence test); Ch. 3 capstone 500s (dropped Redis) and `--scale` fails on a static port. |
| 3 | ❌ fail | Dockering Jekyll with Bootstrap 5 | 33 | Breaks at almost every step: `docker-compose` missing, scaffold conflict, phantom `cd`, gems don't persist, BS4 markup. `draft: true`. |
| 4 | ⚠️ warn | Frontend Forests: Building a Jekyll Site with Bootstrap | 60 | Commands work with workarounds, but Steps 1–8 assume non-existent local theme files and give no Bootstrap snippet; feels like two stitched docs. `draft: true`. |
| 5 | ⚠️ warn | The Artisan's Forge: Refactoring Jekyll Theme Components | 73 | Refactoring pattern is sound and builds end-to-end; `touch` missing `mkdir -p`, an unimplemented config flag, and a duplicated Resources section. |

## 🔬 Evidence

All outcomes below come from commands the execute engine actually ran in its disposable per-quest sandbox (Linux, Docker + Compose v2.38.2 available; no network/registry/GitHub push). Statically-judged steps are labeled `reasoned`.

### 1. container-fundamentals — 77% ⚠️ (snippets: ran 26, passed 24, failed 2, skipped 4)
Per-dimension: commands_work 4 · content_accuracy 3 · completeness 4 · clarity 4 · structure 4 · safety 5.
- ✅ Ch.1 lifecycle `docker pull nginx:alpine … run … stop … rm` ran exactly as documented; image remained in `docker images` after `rm` — confirms the chapter's key claim.
- ✅ Ch.2 `docker build -t container-hello:1.0 .` produced the exact expected log line; `-e PORT=4000` override logged "Listening on port 4000" with no rebuild.
- ✅ Ch.3 caching claim **verified precisely**: after editing `app.js`, WORKDIR / COPY package.json / RUN npm install were all `CACHED`, only `COPY . .` re-ran.
- ❌ Ch.3 multi-stage Dockerfile applied to the Ch.2 project → `npm error Missing script: "build"`. The snippet is a disconnected generic example, not runnable against the project the learner just built.
- ❌ Ch.4 bind-mount "live reload": host edit to `app.js` was **not** reflected by the running `node app.js` (no file watcher) — contradicts "Edits … are seen immediately" and the checkpoint "showed up without rebuilding the image."
- ⏭️ Registry `login/tag/push/pull` and OS-specific installers `skipped` (need real Docker Hub creds / other OSes) — syntax reasoned correct.

### 2. docker-compose-orchestration — 62% ⚠️ (snippets: ran 12, passed 10, failed 2, reasoned 2, skipped 2)
Per-dimension: commands_work 2 · content_accuracy 3 · completeness 3 · clarity 4 · structure 4 · safety 5.
- ✅ Ch.1–2 compose files, Dockerfiles, and lifecycle commands all ran as described; **named-volume persistence verified for real** — data survived `down`/`up` and was deleted by `down -v`.
- ✅ `depends_on: condition: service_healthy` correctly gated `web` until `db` reported Healthy (`docker compose config` resolved cleanly).
- ❌ Ch.3 "Full Stack in Action" `compose.yaml`: reuses Ch.1's Redis-dependent `app.py` but **omits the redis service** → web 500s on every request.
- ❌ Ch.3 `docker compose up -d --scale web=3` → `Bind for 0.0.0.0:8080 failed: port is already allocated` because the service publishes a static host port.
- 💭 macOS `brew install docker-compose` / Windows+WSL / `apt install docker-compose-plugin` — `reasoned`/`skipped` (platform-specific; package names verified correct).

### 3. frontend-docker — 33% ❌ (snippets: ran 5, passed 2, failed 3, reasoned 2, skipped 1)
Per-dimension: commands_work 1 · content_accuracy 1 · completeness 2 · clarity 2 · structure 2 · safety 4.
- ❌ `docker-compose run jekyll jekyll new .` → `command not found` (exit 127): the standalone `docker-compose` binary is absent on modern Docker; and the scaffold conflicts because the dir already holds Dockerfile/compose.yml.
- ❌ `cd my-jekyll-site` → `No such file or directory`: `jekyll new .` scaffolds in place; that subfolder is never created (source line 115).
- ❌ `docker-compose up` (run as `docker compose up`) → container exits code 1 with `Bundler::GemNotFound: Could not find base64-0.3.0, csv-3.…` — gems installed during scaffold don't persist to the serve container. **The quest's final proof-of-success step never serves the site.**
- 💭 `reasoned` fails: `integrity="sha384-xxx"` SRI placeholders (source line ~near CDN block) would block asset loading; navbar markup uses BS4 `data-toggle`/`data-target`, `.jumbotron` (line 170), `.sr-only` (line 155), and a jQuery include — all broken/removed in Bootstrap 5.
- ⏭️ `git … push` to a remote `skipped` (needs real GitHub repo/creds).

### 4. frontend — 60% ⚠️ (snippets: ran 16, passed 12, failed 4, reasoned 2)
Per-dimension: commands_work 3 · content_accuracy 3 · completeness 2 · clarity 3 · structure 2 · safety 5.
- ❌ `bundle install` failed on a permission error to the shared gem path; only succeeded after `bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle` — a stock-Linux learner would be stuck here with no guidance.
- ❌ Step 3/4: `ls _includes` and `ls _layouts` both `No such file or directory` on a fresh `jekyll new` (minima) site — the files the quest tells you to edit live inside the gem, not the project. Editing them as written does nothing.
- ❌ Ch.9 Liquid block: `{​{ page.title }​}`, `{​% if %​}`, `{​% for %​}` rendered correctly, but the `{# … #}` comment syntax (source lines 158–160) renders as **literal visible text** — invalid Liquid; correct form is `{​% comment %​}…{​% endcomment %​}`.
- 💭 `_posts` naming convention and "deploy to GitHub Pages/Netlify" (Step 8) — `reasoned` accurate but generic (no concrete commands).

### 5. jekyll-component-refactoring — 73% ⚠️ (snippets: ran 11, passed 9, failed 2, reasoned 2, skipped 1)
Per-dimension: commands_work 3 · content_accuracy 4 · completeness 3 · clarity 4 · structure 4 · safety 5.
- ✅ The full refactor (config-driven nanobar include, scoped SCSS, full-width footer fix) builds and renders exactly as described — verified with a real `jekyll build`.
- ❌ Step 2.1 `touch _includes/components/nanobar.html` → `No such file or directory` (exit 1): parent dir doesn't exist on a fresh theme; needs `mkdir -p _includes/components` first — exactly the situation of a learner extracting their first component.
- ❌ Phase 7 `bundle exec jekyll build` → `Could not locate Gemfile` (exit 10) in a from-scratch sandbox; plain `jekyll build` succeeded.
- 💭 The `step_animation: false` config flag is defined but never consumed anywhere; the "📚 Resources" section appears twice verbatim; the docker-compose build alternative assumes a service/`_config_dev.yml` the quest never creates.

## 🐞 Issues Found

**High severity**
- **high · frontend-docker · Step 2 scaffold + `docker-compose` CLI** — `docker-compose run jekyll jekyll new .` fails (`command not found`, exit 127) and conflicts with the already-present Dockerfile/compose. *Fix:* scaffold into a genuinely empty dir first and replace all `docker-compose` with `docker compose` (Compose v2).
- **high · frontend-docker · `docker-compose up` (capstone) · gem persistence** — container exits with `Bundler::GemNotFound`; the site never serves. *Fix:* add a named volume for the bundle path (e.g. `bundle_cache:/usr/local/bundle`) or run `bundle install` in the compose `command:` before `jekyll serve`.
- **high · frontend-docker · Step 4 · Bootstrap 5 markup** — BS4 leftovers `data-toggle`/`data-target` (line 149), `.jumbotron` (line 170), `.sr-only` (line 155), jQuery include silently fail in BS5. *Fix:* `data-bs-*`, replace `.jumbotron`, `.visually-hidden`, drop jQuery.
- **high · frontend · Step 3/4 · non-existent local theme files** — a fresh `jekyll new` (minima) site has no local `_includes/head.html` / `_layouts/default.html`; the edits do nothing. *Fix:* tell the learner to copy them out of the theme gem (`bundle show minima`) or use a starter that ships them.
- **high · frontend · Step 3 · missing Bootstrap snippet** — the quest's central skill has zero concrete code (only prose). *Fix:* include the actual pinned Bootstrap CDN `<link>`/`<script>`.
- **high · frontend · Ch.9 · invalid Liquid comment** — `{# … #}` (lines 158–160) renders as literal text. *Fix:* use `{​% comment %​}…{​% endcomment %​}`.
- **high · container-fundamentals · Ch.3 · multi-stage build** — `npm run build` → `Missing script: "build"` against the Ch.2 project. *Fix:* add a real build step to the sample app, or explicitly label the snippet as a generic example for a different project.
- **high · container-fundamentals · Ch.4 · "live reload" overstated** — plain `node app.js` does not reload on host edits. *Fix:* use `node --watch app.js`/nodemon, or soften the claim + checkpoint.
- **high · docker-compose-orchestration · Ch.3 · dropped Redis** — capstone `compose.yaml` reuses the Redis-dependent `app.py` but omits redis → web 500s. *Fix:* add the redis service back (a genuine 3-service stack) or ship a Postgres-only `app.py` for Ch.3.
- **high · docker-compose-orchestration · Ch.3 · `--scale web=3` fails** — static host port → "port is already allocated". *Fix:* remove/range the published port before demonstrating scaling, or add a caveat.
- **high · jekyll-component-refactoring · Step 2.1 · `touch` before `mkdir`** — fails on a fresh theme. *Fix:* `mkdir -p _includes/components && touch _includes/components/nanobar.html`.

**Medium severity**
- **medium · frontend-docker · Step 3 · `cd my-jekyll-site`** — directory never created. *Fix:* remove the step or scaffold with `jekyll new my-jekyll-site`.
- **medium · frontend-docker · Step 3 · SRI `sha384-xxx` placeholders** — silently block asset loading. *Fix:* paste the real hashed snippet from Bootstrap docs.
- **medium · frontend · Step 1 · Ruby/bundle permission error** — stock-Linux `bundle install` fails; needs `bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle` or a version manager. *Fix:* document the workaround.
- **medium · frontend-docker & frontend · placeholder objectives** — both still carry the auto-seeded "Understand the core concepts…" objectives block. *Fix:* write quest-specific outcomes.
- **medium · jekyll-component-refactoring · unimplemented `step_animation` flag** — defined but never consumed. *Fix:* implement or remove the flag and its bonus objective.
- **medium · jekyll-component-refactoring · Steps 2.2 vs 3.3 duplication / SCSS wiring** — clarify that 3.3 replaces 2.2, and show how `_sass/components/_nanobar.scss` reaches the compiled stylesheet.

**Low severity**
- **low · container-fundamentals** — note Docker Hub account is a registry prerequisite; give a concrete image-size ballpark for the "small image" check.
- **low · docker-compose-orchestration** — state Ch.3 assumes Ch.1's `app.py`/Dockerfile/requirements are still present; add colima+Compose plugin note for macOS.
- **low · frontend-docker** — `master` → `main`; mention GitHub Pages' gem allowlist / recommend `actions/jekyll-build-pages`.
- **low · frontend** — merge or clearly split Steps 1–8 vs Ch.9; add Knowledge-Check answers + a prerequisites/rewards section.
- **low · jekyll-component-refactoring** — remove the duplicated "📚 Resources" section; note Phase 7 build needs a Gemfile/`bundle install`.

## 🔗 Chain Continuity

**The slice is two disconnected halves, only one of which is a real chain.**

- **Docker Mastery pair (quests 1→2): genuinely linked and continuous.**
`container-fundamentals` (`required_quests: []`, `unlocks: docker-compose-orchestration`) → `docker-compose-orchestration` (`required_quests: [container-fundamentals]`). Both share `quest_series: Docker Mastery`, `quest_line: The Adventurer's Forge`, `quest_arc: Containers of the Container Coast`. Quest 1 teaches images/build/run/cache; quest 2 correctly assumes that and builds to multi-service orchestration. The one continuity snag: quest 2's Ch.3 silently assumes the learner still has Ch.1's `app.py`/Dockerfile in place — a fresh start there is confusing (flagged low).

- **Frontend Forests pair (quests 3, 4): unlinked, duplicative, and still drafts.**
Both `frontend-docker` and `frontend` are `draft: true`, both belong to a generic "Level 0100 Quest Line" (not Docker Mastery), both carry **empty** `quest_dependencies` and the identical auto-seeded placeholder objectives, and they **overlap heavily** (both "Frontend Forests / Jekyll + Bootstrap 5"). Nothing routes a learner from the Docker sub-chain into them, and nothing distinguishes which to take. This is the slice's biggest structural gap: two half-finished treatments of the same lesson, neither wired into the graph. A Digital Artist finishing quests 1–2 has no signposted next step within this window.

- **Side quest (quest 5): self-contained, softly bridged.** `jekyll-component-refactoring`
is a `side_quest` that `recommends` `frontend-docker`. It stands on its own well (builds end-to-end), but it inherits the frontend pair's weakness by recommending the slice's lowest-scoring, failing quest as a lead-in.

**Prerequisite reality for a real beginner of this class:** Both frontend quests assume a working local Ruby/Jekyll toolchain and existing theme layout files that a fresh `jekyll new` does not provide — the exact wall the execute engine hit. A Digital Artist who came through the Docker sub-chain expecting a container-first path is then told (in `frontend`) to `gem install jekyll` on the host, contradicting the container-no-Ruby-install promise of `frontend-docker`. The two Bootstrap quests need either a merge or a clear "containerized vs. host" split before the chain reads as one journey.

## 🧠 Reasoning & Method

- **Mode:** `execute` (sealed). The `quest-walkthrough` workflow pre-ran the agentic
execute engine deterministically and sealed `walk-evidence.json` / `walk-evidence.md`; per the skill's step 2, I consumed them **as-is** and did **not** re-run the engine (its child `claude` processes can't authenticate from my Bash tool). I did not edit `walk-plan.json` or `walk-evidence.*`.
- **What I ran vs. reasoned:** Every `passed`/`failed` above is a command the engine
actually executed in its disposable per-quest sandbox (evidenced in `walk-evidence.json`'s `commands`/`snippets`). Items labeled `reasoned`/`skipped` were judged statically — OS-specific installers (macOS/Windows), registry pushes, and GitHub remote pushes were **not** run (no creds/other-OS/network), and I flagged them as such rather than claiming outcomes. My own contribution was reading all five quest sources in plan order and reasoning about the **linked journey** (chain continuity above); I cite source line numbers (e.g. frontend.md 158–160, frontend-docker.md 149/155/170) where I quote the quest itself.
- **Coverage / limits:** This is **window 1 of 2** — 5 of the level's 8 quests
(`windowed: true`, `offset 0`). The remaining 3 quests of level 0100 are **out of scope** for this run and untested here. Sandbox was network-restricted (no registry login, no `git push`, outbound curl-to-localhost blocked — the engine worked around the last via `docker exec … wget`, which is a sandbox constraint, not a quest defect). Two quests (`frontend-docker`, `frontend`) are `draft: true`, so their low scores are work-in-progress, not shipped-quest failures.
- **Confidence:** High for the Docker pair and the side quest (high runnable-snippet
coverage: 26/11 and 11/3 recorded, real builds succeeded). Medium for `frontend` (0 fenced-runnable snippets by the engine's count; verified via the engine's reconstructed commands) and for the `reasoned` Bootstrap-markup findings in `frontend-docker` (static judgment against BS5 docs, not a browser render).
