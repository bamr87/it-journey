## 🎯 Session Summary

I walked the **game-developer / 0100 (Frontend & Containers, ⚔️ Adventurer)** slice
that `walk-plan.json` selected — a 3-quest window (window 1 of 2) of an 8-quest
level. The sealed machine evidence (`walk-evidence.json`) **only covers the first
quest**: the engine recorded `evaluated: 1, requested: 3, auth_truncated: true`, so
it stopped after *The Proving Grounds* when the OAuth token hit its rate limit. I did
**not** re-run the engine (its child processes can't authenticate from my Bash tool)
and did **not** touch the evidence files. Quests 2 and 3 are therefore **reasoned
only** — read end-to-end as a learner and cross-checked against host-repo file
existence (read-only), but **never executed in a sandbox**.

The one machine-executed quest passed cleanly at **92%** with every runnable snippet
behaving exactly as documented. The headline verdict is **warn** — not because
anything is broken, but because **two-thirds of the planned slice has no execution
evidence**, and my static read surfaced a real chain-ordering inversion (the harder
CI quest is walked *before* the Git-fundamentals quest that teaches its
prerequisites) plus a disconnected CI example in Quest 2. A maintainer should re-run
this slice with a fresh token to get execution evidence for Quests 2 and 3.

## 🗺️ The Journey

| # | Verdict | Quest | Score | Takeaway |
|---|---------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | ✅ pass (executed) | The Proving Grounds: The Repo's First CI Gate | 92 | Deterministic `verify.py` harness runs exactly as written; one undisclosed glob gotcha. |
| 2 | ⚠️ reasoned only | Mastering the Ancient Arts of Source Control Sorcery | — | Solid self-contained Git quest, but its Chapter 4 CI example is disconnected from the repo the learner built, and it lacks structured `quest_dependencies`. |
| 3 | ⚠️ reasoned only | Profile Themes: Unleashing the Style Sorcerer | — | Coherent repo-internal CSS side quest; referenced files verified to exist; `bundle exec jekyll serve` step conflicts with this repo's Docker-only build. |

## 🔬 Evidence

### Quest 1 — The Proving Grounds *(execute mode, sealed engine evidence)*

**Score 92 · pass · ran 4/5 runnable snippets** (available_total 7, runnable 5, ran 4,
passed 4, failed 0, skipped 1, reasoned 2). Per-dimension: commands_work **5**,
content_accuracy **4**, completeness **4**, clarity **5**, structure **5**, safety **5**.

Commands actually run in the disposable sandbox (from `walk-evidence.json`):

- `mkdir -p scripts/ci` → **passed** — created directory, exit 0.
- `verify.py` emitter half (`emit()`/`finding()`) → **passed** — one error + one
  warning produced sorted, `sort_keys=True` JSONL and return value 1, matching the
  frozen contract.
- `verify.py` checks half (`check_frontmatter()`/`check_links()`) → **reasoned** —
  not runnable in isolation (depends on `finding()` from the prior snippet); by
  design, superseded by the full assembled file. Exercised indirectly below.
- Complete assembled `scripts/ci/verify.py` → **passed** across 5 scenarios:
  (1) clean file → exit 0, empty `findings.jsonl`; (2) missing `author` key → exit 1,
  `fm-required-key` error; (3) no `---` block → `fm-missing` error; (4) malformed
  front matter → handled gracefully, no crash; (5) dead site-absolute link →
  `link-broken` **warning** (does not fail gate), relative dead links ignored.
  **Determinism confirmed**: re-ran twice on identical state → byte-identical
  `findings.jsonl`.
- `pip install pyyaml && python scripts/ci/verify.py` → **passed** — pyyaml 6.0.3
  already present on Python 3.12.13; ran verbatim.
- `.github/workflows/verify.yml` → **reasoned** — not executable outside GitHub
  Actions; YAML parses, action versions (`checkout@v4`, `setup-python@v5`,
  `upload-artifact@v4`) current as of 2026.
- Mermaid quest-network diagram → **skipped** — sandbox lacks a usable Chromium
  sandbox (Puppeteer "No usable sandbox!"), an environment limit, not a quest defect;
  statically validated as well-formed `graph LR` syntax.

Engine summary (verbatim): *"Every runnable snippet was executed in the sandbox and
behaved exactly as the quest describes… The main gap is an undisclosed real-world
gotcha — the harness's unscoped Markdown glob will immediately flag a plain
README.md — plus the branch-protection step being UI-only with no scriptable
equivalent; otherwise this is a clear, well-sequenced, safe, and technically accurate
quest."*

### Quest 2 — Source Control Sorcery *(reasoned only — NOT executed)*

No sandbox evidence (auth-truncated before this quest). Read end-to-end. It is a
self-contained, well-structured Git quest: three-stage model, `git init`/`add`/
`commit`/`push`, branch create/merge/delete, PR template, and a GitHub Actions
example, with per-chapter Knowledge Checks and three implementation challenges. The
platform-selector (macOS/Windows/Linux/Cloud) install block is accurate. I did **not**
run any command; all observations below are static.

### Quest 3 — Profile Themes *(reasoned only — NOT executed)*

No sandbox evidence. Read end-to-end and cross-checked its repo-internal references
against the host tree (read-only file-existence checks, not execution):

- `assets/css/contributor-profile.css` → **exists** ✓ (Step 1 target is real).
- `_includes/contributor/character_sheet.html` → **exists** ✓, and contains **no**
  existing `theme` logic (grep returned no matches), so Step 5/6's "add theme class /
  load theme CSS" edits are genuinely net-new, not redundant.
- `_data/contributors/` → **exists** ✓ with `_template.yml` + real contributor YAML
  (`bamr87.yml`, etc.), so Step 5's `_data/contributors/YOUR_USERNAME.yml` edit has a
  realistic target.
- Prerequisite quest `/quests/0001/forge-your-character/` → file **exists** ✓.
- `assets/css/themes/` directory → **does not pre-exist**, but Step 3 *creates* a file
  there and Git will create the directory on `git add`, so this is not a blocker.

## 🐞 Issues Found

**Quest 1 (evidenced in sandbox):**

- **medium · Quest 1 · `scripts/ci/verify.py` `main()` glob** — the harness walks
  `Path(".").glob("**/*.md")` with no scoping to a content directory. The engine
  observed in-sandbox that a plain `README.md` with no front matter immediately trips
  `fm-missing` and fails the gate, contradicting the quest's "a clean repo prints
  nothing and exits 0" claim for any real repo (which almost always has a README).
  *Fix:* scope the glob (e.g. `pages/`/`_quests/`) or add a one-line caveat that
  non-content Markdown must be excluded.
- **low · Quest 1 · Chapter 2 branch protection** — promotion to a required check is
  described only via the Settings UI; no scriptable `gh api …/branches/main/protection`
  equivalent for learners who want the whole quest reproducible. *Fix:* add the `gh`
  CLI alternative alongside the UI steps.
- **low · Quest 1 · `verify.yml` `on:` key** — a learner who `yaml.safe_load()`s the
  workflow sees `on:` coerced to boolean `True` (YAML 1.1 quirk); harmless for GitHub
  Actions but a confusing detour. *Fix:* one-line footnote.

**Quest 2 (reasoned — static read, NOT executed):**

- **medium · Quest 2 · Chapter 4, `.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml`** — the CI
  example runs `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm audit`, `npm run coverage`,
  but the repo the learner actually builds in Chapters 1–2 contains only `README.md`
  and `auth.js` — no `package.json` and no npm scripts. A beginner who wires this
  workflow into *their* repo would hit `npm ci` failing on a missing lockfile. *Fix:*
  either scaffold a minimal `package.json`/scripts earlier, or explicitly state the
  workflow is illustrative for a Node project rather than the repo built here. *(Not
  verified in a sandbox — reasoned from the quest source.)*
- **low · Quest 2 · frontmatter** — the quest has only a prose `prerequisites` list
  and no structured `quest_dependencies` block (unlike Quests 1 and 3 in this slice).
  Beyond the rubric gap, this is why the planner can't dependency-sort it ahead of
  Quest 1 (see Chain Continuity). *Fix:* add `quest_dependencies` wiring it before the
  CI/Actions quests it underpins.
- **low · Quest 2 · Chapter 1 remote push** — `git remote add origin …yourusername/
  my-first-quest.git` + `git push -u origin main` assumes the learner has already
  created the remote repo and configured auth; a real beginner will get a push
  failure with no guidance. *Fix:* one line pointing to creating the GitHub repo /
  `gh repo create` first. *(Reasoned.)*

**Quest 3 (reasoned — static read, NOT executed):**

- **low · Quest 3 · Step 7 build command** — `bundle exec jekyll serve` conflicts with
  this repo's documented reality (host Ruby can't build the site; the Docker path via
  the `run-it-journey` skill is required for the `jekyll-theme-zer0` gem ≥1.21 /
  Ruby ≥3.2). A contributor following this literally on the host may hit a gem/Ruby
  version wall. *Fix:* point at the repo's Docker build (`make serve`) or note the
  Ruby version requirement. *(Reasoned.)*
- **no blocking issues otherwise** — every repo-internal path the quest references was
  verified to exist, and the prerequisite quest resolves.

## 🔗 Chain Continuity

The three quests share level 0100 but come from **three unrelated series** —
*The Self-Operating Website* (Q1, chapter 2 of a CI campaign), *Foundation
Development Skills* (Q2, Git), and *Contributor Chronicles* (Q3, a CSS side quest).
This is a **thematic** level grouping, not a linear campaign, and this window is
"1 of 2" of an 8-quest level, so the learner meets it mid-level.

**Ordering inversion (the main continuity finding).** Q1 (*The Proving Grounds*)
lists as prerequisites "Comfortable with Git, branches, and pull requests" and "Basic
GitHub Actions familiarity" — which is *exactly what Q2 (Source Control Sorcery)
teaches from scratch*. Yet the planner walks Q1 before Q2. A learner hitting this
window cold would be asked to build a required-status-check CI gate and open a
deliberately-broken PR (Q1's Mastery Challenge) **before** the quest that teaches
branches, PRs, and GitHub Actions. Root cause: Q1 carries structured
`quest_dependencies` (recommends *The Summoning* 0001, unlocks *The War Machine*
1000) while Q2 has **no** `quest_dependencies` block at all, so the dependency sorter
has nothing telling it Q2 should precede Q1. Adding `quest_dependencies` to Q2 (see
Issues) would let the planner order the foundation before the application.

**Q3 is independent.** It is gated on *Forge Your Character* (0001, verified to exist)
and stands alone as a contributor CSS side quest — it neither requires nor is required
by Q1/Q2, so its position in the window is harmless.

**Path-flavor note (game-developer).** None of these three quests are game-dev
specific — a CI gate, generic Git, and a profile-theming CSS exercise are shared
level-0100 foundation content surfaced across every character path. For a
game-developer learner the slice reads as generic groundwork rather than
craft-relevant, which is fine for an Adventurer-tier foundation level but worth
flagging: the "character path" framing is thin in this particular window.

## 🧠 Reasoning & Method

- **What I ran vs. reasoned:** I ran **nothing** myself against the quests. Quest 1's
  evidence is the **sealed, workflow-minted** `walk-evidence.json` (execute mode,
  disposable sandbox, 23 turns, ~$0.80) — I consumed it as-is. Quests 2 and 3 are
  **reasoned only**: I read each source end-to-end in plan order and, for Q3,
  performed read-only host-repo file-existence checks to ground the observations.
  Every Q2/Q3 issue is labeled reasoned and cites the quoted quest line, not an
  executed command.
- **Coverage / truncation (mandatory honesty):** the plan requested 3 quests; the
  engine sealed evidence for **only 1** (`evaluated: 1, requested: 3,
  auth_truncated: true`) — the OAuth token rate-limited before Quests 2 and 3 were
  reached. Per the skill I did **not** re-run the engine and did **not** hand-write or
  edit any evidence. So **2 of 3 quests in this slice have no execution evidence.** A
  maintainer wanting sandbox verdicts for Q2/Q3 must re-dispatch this slice with a
  fresh token.
- **Skipped/limited in Q1:** the Mermaid render was skipped (no Chromium sandbox —
  environment, not defect); two snippets were `reasoned` (the isolated checks-half,
  and the workflow YAML that can't run outside GitHub Actions).
- **Verdict rationale:** `warn`, not `pass` — the single evaluated quest is a clean
  92% pass, but reporting the slice as green would misrepresent the 1/3 execution
  coverage and bury the chain-ordering inversion. `warn` reflects "no blockers found,
  but incomplete evidence + real structural gaps to address."
- **Confidence:** high for Quest 1 (machine-executed, determinism confirmed); medium
  for Quests 2 and 3 (static reasoning plus file-existence checks, no runtime).
- **Scope discipline:** read-only over all content; my only write is this report. No
  quest edited, no branch/commit/PR, no engine re-run.
