Using keyboard shortcuts
------------------------

To use a keyboard shortcut, press and hold one or more modifier keys and then press the last key of the shortcut. For example, to use Command-C (copy), press and hold the Command key, then the C key, then release both keys. Mac menus and keyboards often use [symbols for certain keys](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/what-are-those-symbols-shown-in-menus-cpmh0011/mac), including modifier keys:

-   Command (or Cmd) ⌘
-   Shift ⇧

-   Option (or Alt) ⌥
-   Control (or Ctrl) ⌃

-   Caps Lock ⇪
-   Fn ![](https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/mac/mac-fn-key-globe-icon.png)

On keyboards made for Windows PCs, use the Alt key instead of Option, and the Ctrl key or Windows logo key instead of Command.

Some keys on some Apple keyboards have special symbols and functions, such as for display brightness ![](https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/il/keyboard-icon-increase-display-brightness.png), keyboard brightness ![](https://support.apple.com/library/content/dam/edam/applecare/images/en_US/il/keyboard-icon-increase-keyboard-brightness.png), and more. If these functions aren't available on your keyboard, you might be able to reproduce some of them by [creating your own keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/create-keyboard-shortcuts-for-apps-mchlp2271/mac). To use these keys as F1, F2, F3, or other standard function keys, combine them with the Fn key.
