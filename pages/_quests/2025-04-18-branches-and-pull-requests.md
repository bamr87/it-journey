🧙‍♂️ Branch Like a Wizard: GitHub PR Sorcery 101
=================================================

Welcome to the enchanted forest of GitHub, where every branch is a path, and every pull request (PR) is a summoning ritual. Here's how to avoid conjuring chaos and keep your repo realm pristine.

* * * *

🌱 Branches: Not Just for Trees
-------------------------------

Treat your repo like a magical kingdom. You wouldn't build your dragon stable in the throne room, right? Same goes for your code. Use **branches** to separate your experiments, fixes, and glorious new features.

### ✨ The Five Sacred Branch Types:

| 🧪 Branch Type | 🏷️ Example | 🔮 Purpose | 🛡️ PR Requirements |
| --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |
| **Main** | `main` | Sacred source of truth (prod) | Must be peer-reviewed & tested by CI elders |
| --- |  --- |  --- |  --- |
| **Feature** | `feature/frog-translator` | New magic spell (feature) | Describe it well, include test scrolls |
| **Bugfix** | `bugfix/unicorn-glitch` | Patch a wild bug | Show your work: bug ref + how to summon it |
| **Hotfix** | `hotfix/melted-cauldron` | Urgent fix (prod on fire) | Small, fast, reviewed with haste |
| **Release** | `release/v3.1.4` | Prepare for kingdom-wide update | Reviewed, changelog updated, tagged with care |

* * * *

🧾 The Pull Request Prophecy
----------------------------

Think of a PR like a scroll you send to the council. It must be clear, complete, and convincing. If you send in a blank scroll with a title like "stuff," expect it to be eaten by the dragons of indifference.

### 📜 Required PR Runes:

-   **🧙 Description**: What magic did you perform and why?

-   **🪄 Issue Reference**: Link the scroll that foretold this change.

-   **🧪 Test Plan**: Describe the rituals used to verify your work.

-   **🎞️ Screenshots/Demos**: Visual proof your enchantments work (especially UI).

-   **✅ Reviewer Checklist**: Guide your reviewer like a map through the mountains.

### 🧪 Sample PR Template:

```

```

So next time you open a PR, channel your inner mage. Make it clear. Make it tested. And always, always remember: the main branch is sacred ground---don't walk on it with muddy boots.
