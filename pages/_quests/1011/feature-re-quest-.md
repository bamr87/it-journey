## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 1: The Intake Enchantment - Natural Language to Structured Requirements

*The first stage of our AI-orchestrated pipeline transforms raw human ideas into structured, actionable specifications. Here you'll learn to harness AI's natural language processing powers to clarify ambiguities, generate user stories, and create machine-parseable requirements.*

### ⚔️ Skills You'll Forge in This Chapter
- Natural language processing for requirement gathering
- AI-assisted ambiguity resolution and clarification
- Structured specification generation (JSON, YAML, Markdown)
- Model Context Protocol setup for requirement management
- Integration with project management tools (GitHub Issues, Jira)

### 🏗️ Building Your Intake Pipeline Foundation

**Step 1: Set up your AI orchestration environment**

```python
# Install the AI orchestration framework
pip install langchain anthropic openai mcp-client

# Create your first AI agent for requirement processing
from langchain.agents import Agent
from mcp import MCPClient

class RequirementProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.llm = Anthropic(api_key="your-key")
        self.mcp_client = MCPClient()
    
    async def process_user_request(self, raw_request: str):
        """Transform natural language into structured requirements"""
        # AI processes the request and generates structured output
        structured_req = await self.llm.agenerate({
            "prompt": f"Convert this feature request into structured format: {raw_request}",
            "schema": "user_story_schema.json"
        })
        return structured_req
```

**Why this matters**: The intake stage is critical because unclear requirements lead to failed projects. AI excels at parsing natural language and asking clarifying questions that humans might miss.

**Step 2: Create your requirement schema**

```json
{
  "user_story_schema": {
    "title": "string",
    "description": "string", 
    "acceptance_criteria": ["string"],
    "technical_requirements": ["string"],
    "dependencies": ["string"],
    "complexity_estimate": "low|medium|high",
    "priority": "critical|high|medium|low"
  }
}
```

**Step 3: Test your intake pipeline**

```bash
# Test the requirement processor
echo "I want users to be able to reset their passwords via email" | python intake_agent.py

# Expected output: Structured JSON with user story, acceptance criteria, and technical specs
```

### 🔍 Knowledge Check: Intake Processing
