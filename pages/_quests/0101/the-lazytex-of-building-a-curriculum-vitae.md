## 🧙‍♂️ Epic Introduction

In the vast digital matrix where data flows like rivers of light, the guild calls you to forge your
most enduring artifact: your Curriculum Vitae. This quest is a binary incantation at Level 0101
(5)—a tool‑mastery adventure to craft a polished, ATS‑friendly CV using VS Code and LaTeX. Your
primary artifact, the template `cv.tex`, awaits in your vault (e.g., `cv/cv.tex`). You will
customize its runes (sections), compile it into a pristine PDF, and emerge with a battle‑ready
professional codex.

You’ll master LaTeX Workshop in VS Code, install the proper TeX distribution for your realm,
customize sections like Education, Professional Experience, Projects, and Skills, and verify
clickable links and fonts. When the final spell completes, your CV will compile cleanly—ready to
present to any council of hiring sages.

### 🌟 The Legend Behind This Quest

Across realms, masters encode their journeys in machine‑readable scrolls that pass ATS trials.
LaTeX transforms chaos into elegant structure and precise typography. With VS Code as your
processing crystal, you’ll weave algorithmic layout spells into an artifact that compiles
flawlessly on any platform.

## 🎯 Quest Objectives

By the time you complete this journey, you will have:

### Primary Objectives

- [ ] Install a LaTeX toolchain and VS Code extensions for your platform
- [ ] Open and compile the provided `cv.tex` to PDF without errors
- [ ] Replace placeholders with your own details across Contact, Education, Experience, Skills, and Strengths
- [ ] Ensure links (email, LinkedIn, GitHub, website) are clickable (PDF)

### Secondary Objectives (Bonus)

- [ ] Add a headshot image and verify layout alignment
- [ ] Create role‑specific variants (e.g., Tech vs. Finance) via Git branches or file copies
- [ ] Configure a VS Code build recipe (`latexmk -pdf`) and forward‑search preview

### Mastery Indicators

- [ ] You can compile from VS Code and from the terminal
- [ ] You can add new sections (Projects/Certifications) using the template’s custom commands
- [ ] You can troubleshoot missing packages and path issues

---

## 🌍 Choose Your Adventure Platform

Different platforms offer unique paths. Choose your realm.

### 🍎 macOS Kingdom Path

```zsh
# Install VS Code extension
# In VS Code: Extensions → install "LaTeX Workshop" by James-Yu

# Install MacTeX (no GUI) or BasicTeX (lighter)
brew install --cask mactex-no-gui

# Ensure TeX binaries are on PATH for shell and VS Code
echo 'export PATH="/Library/TeX/texbin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Optional: verify toolchain
which latexmk && latexmk --version
```

Notes:

- If you prefer a smaller footprint: `brew install --cask basictex` then
  `sudo tlmgr update --self && sudo tlmgr install latexmk fontawesome5 CormorantGaramond`.

### 🪟 Windows Empire Path

```powershell
# Install MiKTeX
# Download from https://miktex.org/download and complete setup
# During first compile, allow package on-the-fly installation

# VS Code: install "LaTeX Workshop" extension
```

### 🐧 Linux Territory Path

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y texlive-full
# or minimal + extras
# sudo apt-get install -y texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-extra latexmk

# VS Code: install "LaTeX Workshop" extension
```

### 📱 Universal Web Path (Optional)

If local toolchains are restricted, you can test in Overleaf, then return to VS Code to finalize.
This quest focuses on local VS Code mastery.

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 1: Awaken the Processing Crystal (VS Code + Extensions)

### ⚔️ Skills You'll Forge

- Install and verify TeX toolchain and LaTeX Workshop
- Understand default recipes (`latexmk -pdf`)
- Use Preview (forward/inverse search)

### 🔧 Implementation: Verify the Forge

Open VS Code → open the `cv/` folder → open `cv.tex`. Use the TeX sidebar (TeX icon) and run
“Build LaTeX project”. If the build fails with missing packages, install them via your TeX package
manager (`tlmgr` on macOS BasicTeX/TeX Live, MiKTeX on Windows).

Tip: LaTeX Workshop usually runs `latexmk -pdf`. You can also compile in a terminal:

```bash
latexmk -pdf cv.tex
```

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 2: Summon the Template (Link to cv.tex)

Your core artifact lives at: `cv/cv.tex`. It already includes:

- Packages: `fontawesome5`, `CormorantGaramond`, `hyperref`, `multicol`, `titlesec`, `tabularx`,
  `graphicx`, and ATS aid `\\pdfgentounicode=1`
- Custom commands: `\\resumeSubheading`, `\\resumeItem`, lists, and section scaffolds
- Optional headshot: `\\includegraphics[width=0.15\\linewidth]{Amr-Headshot_v3.jpg}`

### 🔧 Implementation: Prepare Assets

- Place your headshot image in the same directory as `cv.tex` and update the filename if needed
- Verify `PATH` includes TeX binaries so VS Code can spawn the compiler
- If fonts are missing, install via your TeX manager (e.g., `tlmgr install CormorantGaramond fontawesome5`)

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 3: Engrave the Runes (Customize Sections)

Use the template’s custom commands to populate your story.

### Education

Fill each school with `\\resumeSubheading{Institution}{Dates}{Degree}{Location}` and a nested bullet list for GPA/Emphasis.

### Professional Experience

For each role, use `\\resumeSubheading{Company}{Dates}{Title}{Location}` and add quantified bullets
with `\\resumeItem{...}`. Keep 3–5 bullets per role.

### Projects / Skills / Strengths

Populate as provided in the template. Add new items using the same list patterns and keep concise, outcome‑focused language.

Example snippet (structure only):

```tex
\\resumeSubheading{Your Company}{Jan 2023 -- Present}{Your Title}{City, ST}
  \\resumeItemListStart
    \\resumeItem{Delivered X by doing Y, resulting in Z% improvement}
    \\resumeItem{Built A using B and C; reduced cost/time by N}
  \\resumeItemListEnd
```

ATS Tip: Keep graphics minimal, keep text selectable, and ensure links use `\\href{}`. The
template already activates Unicode mapping.

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 4: Compile, Validate, and Polish

### Build

- Use the TeX sidebar Build button, or run `latexmk -pdf cv.tex`
- Resolve missing packages when prompted

### Validate

- Ensure the PDF has clickable email/LinkedIn/GitHub links
- Verify headshot placement (or comment it out if not desired)
- Confirm sections fit on 1–2 pages; trim where needed

### Polish

- Use strong verbs, quantified results, and consistent tense
- Keep consistent punctuation and spacing in bullets
- Update last modified date if you track it in the doc

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 5: Variants, Versioning, and Automation

- Create copies: `cv-tech.tex`, `cv-finance.tex` for role targeting
- Track changes in Git; commit PDFs to a `dist/` folder if desired
- Optional LaTeX Workshop recipe (settings JSON) for explicit control:

```json
{
  "latex-workshop.latex.recipes": [
    { "name": "latexmk (pdf)", "tools": ["latexmk"] }
  ],
  "latex-workshop.latex.tools": [
    { "name": "latexmk", "command": "latexmk", "args": ["-pdf", "-interaction=nonstopmode", "-synctex=1", "%DOC%"], "env": {} }
  ]
}
```
