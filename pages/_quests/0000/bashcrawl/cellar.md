*The cellar reeks of wine and secrets. Barrels line the walls; cobwebs drape the ceiling. Four iron doors lead deeper into the dungeon — armoury, chapel, vault, scrap. But first you must find the emerald amulet.*

## 🎯 Quest Objectives

- [ ] Identify every file type in the cellar using `ls -F`
- [ ] Use the `file` command to interrogate items
- [ ] Create a useful alias to speed up exploration
- [ ] Find and collect the emerald amulet
- [ ] Locate all four exits (armoury, chapel, vault, scrap)

## �️ Quest Prerequisites

- [Entrance side-quest](/quests/0000/side-quests/entrance/) complete
- Know how to use `ls`, `cd`, and `cat`

## ⚡ Command Cheatsheet

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ls -F` | List with type markers |
| `ls -la` | Long listing, including hidden files |
| `file filename` | Describe what type of file this is |
| `alias name='cmd'` | Create a command shortcut |
| `alias` | List all defined aliases |
| `unalias name` | Remove an alias |
| `type name` | Show how a name is resolved (builtin/alias/function/file) |

### `ls -F` Symbol Key

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `/` | Directory |
| `*` | Executable file |
| `@` | Symbolic link |
| `=` | Socket |
| `\|` | Named pipe (FIFO) |
| *(none)* | Regular file |

## 🗺️ Walkthrough

### Step 1 — Survey the cellar

```bash
ls -F
# Example output:
# emerald_amulet  armoury/  chapel/  vault/  scrap/  dusty_scroll  recipe*
```

Notice the variety: a regular file (`emerald_amulet`), directories (`/`), and an executable (`recipe*`).

### Step 2 — Investigate with `file`

```bash
file dusty_scroll
# dusty_scroll: ASCII text

file recipe
# recipe: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable
```

`file` reads the file's magic bytes — much more reliable than guessing from the name.

### Step 3 — Read the scroll

```bash
cat dusty_scroll
```

The scroll reveals a clue about the emerald amulet's location and warns about hidden traps in the deeper chambers.

### Step 4 — Collect the amulet

```bash
cat emerald_amulet
```

Reading it adds it to your inventory. Verify:

```bash
inventory
# Shows: emerald amulet ✓
```

### Step 5 — Create a helpful alias

```bash
# Quick inventory check shortcut
alias inv='inventory'

# Quick navigation shortcut
alias back='cd ..'

# Verify
alias
```

Aliases last only for the current session unless added to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`.

### Step 6 — Identify all four exits

```bash
ls -F
# armoury/  chapel/  vault/  scrap/
```

Each leads to a distinct area of the dungeon. You can tackle them in any order.

## 💡 Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `alias: bad alias name` | Space in alias name | Use underscores: `alias my_cmd='...'` |
| `inventory` not found | Not in game shell | Start with `./main.sh --interactive` |
| Can't find emerald amulet | Wrong directory | `pwd`; make sure you are in CELLAR |
| All four exits missing | Older game version | Run `./setup.sh --repair` |

## ✅ Validation

- [ ] You can explain every `ls -F` symbol from memory
- [ ] You created and tested at least one alias
- [ ] The emerald amulet is in your inventory
- [ ] You know which four chambers you can enter next

## ➡️ Next Steps

Choose your next chamber — all four are unlocked:

| Chamber | Skills | Link |
|---------|--------|------|
| ⚔️ Armoury | Permissions, `chmod`, combat | [Armoury](/quests/0000/side-quests/armoury/) |
| ⛪ Hidden Chapel | Hidden files, `man` pages | [Chapel](/quests/0000/side-quests/hidden-chapel/) |
| 🔒 Vault | Environment variables, `export` | [Vault](/quests/0000/side-quests/vault/) |
| 🗑️ Scrap Heap | Symbolic links, `ln -s` | [Scrap](/quests/0000/side-quests/scrap/) |
