*The wine cellar wall flickers. A hidden door appears — but only `ls -a` can see it. Beyond the false stone lies a chapel with five secret areas, guarded by a monster who fears knowledge.*

## 🎯 Quest Objectives

- [ ] Use `ls -a` to reveal the hidden `.CHAPEL` directory
- [ ] Navigate into `.CHAPEL` and explore the courtyard
- [ ] Reach the aviary and find the feather clue
- [ ] Consult `man` pages to learn the monster's weakness
- [ ] Navigate to the hall and defeat `./monster`
- [ ] Enter the library and collect the ancient tome
- [ ] Explore the graveyard — optional but rewarding

## �️ Quest Prerequisites

- [Cellar side-quest](/quests/0000/side-quests/cellar/) complete
- Comfortable with `ls`, `cd`, and basic file reading

## ⚡ Command Cheatsheet

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ls -a` | List **all** files, including hidden ones (names starting with `.`) |
| `ls -la` | Long format + all files |
| `man command` | Open the manual page for a command |
| `info command` | Alternative documentation viewer |
| `command --help` | Quick built-in help |
| `q` | Quit the `man` pager |
| `/keyword` | Search inside `man` — then `n` for next match |

### About Dotfiles and Hidden Directories

Any file or directory whose name begins with `.` is **hidden** from `ls` by default. Use `ls -a` to see them.

```bash
ls
# regular_file  visible_dir/

ls -a
# .  ..  .CHAPEL/  .hidden_scroll  regular_file  visible_dir/
```

`.` is the current directory. `..` is the parent. Do not delete either.

## 🗺️ Walkthrough

### Step 1 — Reveal the hidden chapel

From the cellar:

```bash
ls -a
# .  ..  armoury/  .CHAPEL/  emerald_amulet  dusty_scroll  recipe*  scrap/  vault/
```

`.CHAPEL/` is invisible with plain `ls` — only `ls -a` shows it.

### Step 2 — Enter and explore the courtyard

```bash
cd .CHAPEL
ls -F
# courtyard/  hall/  library/  graveyard/

cd courtyard
ls -F
# aviary/  birdbath  stone_bench
cat birdbath
# "Birds know the secret. Look to the aviary."
```

### Step 3 — The aviary clue

```bash
cd aviary
ls -F
# eagle*  feather  perch/
cat feather
# "The monster fears: man grep"
```

This tells you to consult `man grep` — the solution to defeating the monster is hidden in the grep manual.

### Step 4 — Study the man page

```bash
man grep
# Opens the pager. Search with /pattern
# Press / then type "line number" and press Enter
# Press q to quit
```

> Tip: `man grep | grep "\-n"` pipes the manual through grep to find the `-n` flag quickly.

The relevant knowledge: `grep -n` prints line numbers. The hall monster demands you specify which line contains the incantation.

### Step 5 — Navigate to the hall and fight

```bash
cd ../hall
ls -F
# inscription  monster*  locked_door

cat inscription
# "Invoke grep with the flag that shows line numbers."

./monster
# The monster demands: "Which grep flag shows line numbers?"
# Your answer: -n
# The monster falls!
```

### Step 6 — Collect the tome from the library

```bash
cd ../library
ls -F
# tome  reading_nook/

cat tome
# The Ancient Tome of Shell Knowledge — tome fragment obtained.
inventory
```

### Step 7 (Optional) — Explore the graveyard

```bash
cd ../graveyard
ls -a
# columbarium/  .mausoleum/  royal_tombs/  epitaph

cat epitaph
# "Here lie commands executed without --help."
```

The mausoleum is another hidden directory. Explore it for bonus lore and a secret item.

## 💡 Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `No such directory: .CHAPEL` | Used `ls` instead of `ls -a` | Always use `ls -a` when searching |
| `man` opens strange pager | Default pager not `less` | Press `q` to quit; or `export PAGER=less` |
| Monster won't accept answer | Case sensitivity | Try both `n` and `-n` |
| Tome not in inventory | Used `less` instead of `cat` | `cat tome` adds it to inventory |

## ✅ Validation

- [ ] You can explain why `ls -a` is needed to see `.CHAPEL`
- [ ] You know how to search inside a `man` page
- [ ] The monster is defeated
- [ ] The ancient tome is in your inventory
- [ ] You explored at least four of the five chapel sub-areas
