*Racks of weapons line the walls. Suits of armour stand at attention. But every sword and potion is locked behind a permission barrier — you must learn `chmod` before you can equip a single item.*

## 🕹️ Play This Chamber

This page is your **walkthrough and strategy guide** — play right here in the browser, then follow the steps below.

{% include bashcrawl-terminal.html room="Armoury" %}

## 🎯 Quest Objectives

- [ ] Read `ls -l` output and interpret permission bits
- [ ] Use `chmod` to make scripts executable
- [ ] Run `./potion` to restore health
- [ ] Run `./sword` to equip your weapon
- [ ] Defeat the armoury guardian
- [ ] Proceed to the Chamber

## �️ Quest Prerequisites

- [Cellar side-quest](/quests/0000/side-quests/cellar/) complete
- Comfortable with `ls -F`, `cat`, and file navigation

## ⚡ Command Cheatsheet

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ls -l` | Long listing — shows permissions, owner, size |
| `chmod +x file` | Add execute permission for everyone |
| `chmod 755 file` | `rwxr-xr-x` — owner can all; others can read+execute |
| `chmod 644 file` | `rw-r--r--` — owner can read+write; others read only |
| `./script` | Execute a script in the current directory |

### Permission String Decoder

```text
-rwxr-xr-x
│└──┘└──┘└──┘
│ u   g   o
│ user group others
└── file type: - = regular, d = dir, l = link
```

Each group: `r` = read (4), `w` = write (2), `x` = execute (1)

Octal shorthand: `755` = `rwx r-x r-x`, `644` = `rw- r-- r--`

## 🗺️ Walkthrough

### Step 1 — Inspect the armoury

```bash
ls -l
# -rw-r--r-- 1 user group  512 Jan 01 potion
# -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 1024 Jan 01 sword
# -rwxr-xr-x 1 user group  256 Jan 01 guardian*
```

`potion` and `sword` lack the `x` bit — they are **not yet executable**. You cannot run them.

### Step 2 — Try running a locked script

```bash
./potion
# bash: ./potion: Permission denied
```

This is the expected result. Now fix it.

### Step 3 — Grant execute permission

```bash
chmod +x potion
chmod +x sword
ls -l potion sword
# -rwxr-xr-x 1 user group 512 Jan 01 potion*
# -rwxr-xr-x 1 user group 1024 Jan 01 sword*
```

### Step 4 — Drink the potion

```bash
./potion
# HP restored: 50 → 100
```

### Step 5 — Pick up the sword

```bash
./sword
# Sword of Echoes added to inventory.
```

### Step 6 — Face the guardian

```bash
./guardian
# A stone golem steps forward...
# You raise your sword...
# [combat sequence]
```

With the sword equipped, you should win. Health permitting, the guardian falls and the door to the Chamber opens.

## 💡 Understanding Octal Permissions

| Octal | Symbolic | Who Can Do What |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| `777` | `rwxrwxrwx` | Everyone can read, write, execute ⚠️ |
| `755` | `rwxr-xr-x` | Owner: all; others: read + execute ✅ |
| `644` | `rw-r--r--` | Owner: read + write; others: read only ✅ |
| `600` | `rw-------` | Owner only — private files 🔒 |
| `400` | `r--------` | Read-only, even for owner |

> **Security note:** Never use `chmod 777` on scripts or sensitive files. Use `755` for scripts and `644` for data.

## 💡 Common Pitfalls

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Permission denied` after chmod | Not the file owner | Use `ls -l` to check owner |
| Script does nothing | Missing shebang line | Add `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as line 1 |
| `No such file: ./sword` | Wrong directory | `pwd` and `ls` first |
| Health still low after potion | Bug in game version | Run `./setup.sh --repair` |

## ✅ Validation

- [ ] You can read a permission string like `rwxr-xr--` without looking it up
- [ ] You understand why `./` is needed to run a script
- [ ] You ran both `./potion` and `./sword` successfully
- [ ] The guardian is defeated and the Chamber door is open
