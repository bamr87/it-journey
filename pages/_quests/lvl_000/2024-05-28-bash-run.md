Starting with bashrun as a base and building upon it is a great way to create an advanced terminal-based game. bashrun is typically built using shell scripts, which can be a bit limiting but also provides a good foundation for learning and expanding.

Here's a step-by-step guide to start with bashrun and build upon it:

### Step 1: Setting Up bashrun

1. **Clone the bashrun Repository:**
   If bashrun is hosted on a repository, you can clone it using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashrun.git bashrun
   cd bashrun
   ```

2. **Understand the Structure:**
   Explore the directory structure and understand how the game is organized. Typically, it might include directories for maps, scripts for different levels, and resources for the game.

### Step 2: Basic Improvements

1. **Enhance Storyline and Levels:**
   - Add new levels with more complex puzzles and objectives.
   - Create more detailed and engaging storylines.

   Example of adding a new level (`level2.sh`):
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Welcome to Level 2!"
   echo "You need to find the hidden key to unlock the treasure."

   # Player actions and logic here
   ```

2. **Improve Navigation and Interaction:**
   Add more commands for interaction, such as examining objects or using items.

   Example of an interaction command:
   ```bash
   function examine {
       case $1 in
           "key")
               echo "It's a shiny golden key. It might unlock something."
               ;;
           "door")
               echo "It's a sturdy wooden door. It seems to be locked."
               ;;
           *)
               echo "You can't examine that."
               ;;
       esac
   }
   ```

3. **Add an Inventory System:**
   Implement a simple inventory system to manage items collected by the player.

   Example inventory system:
   ```bash
   inventory=()

   function add_to_inventory {
       inventory+=("$1")
       echo "$1 added to your inventory."
   }

   function show_inventory {
       echo "Your inventory: ${inventory[@]}"
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Advanced Features

1. **Implement Save/Load Functionality:**
   Allow players to save their progress and load it later.

   Example save/load system:
   ```bash
   function save_game {
       echo "${inventory[@]}" > savefile.txt
       echo "Game saved."
   }

   function load_game {
       if [ -f savefile.txt ]; then
           inventory=($(cat savefile.txt))
           echo "Game loaded."
       else
           echo "No saved game found."
       fi
   }
   ```

2. **Add a Combat System:**
   Create a simple combat system where players can encounter enemies and engage in battles.

   Example combat system:
   ```bash
   function combat {
       local enemy_health=10
       local player_health=20

       echo "You encounter an enemy!"

       while [ $enemy_health -gt 0 ] && [ $player_health -gt 0 ]; do
           echo "Choose an action: [attack/run]"
           read action
           case $action in
               "attack")
                   enemy_health=$((enemy_health - 2))
                   player_health=$((player_health - 1))
                   echo "You attack the enemy. Enemy health: $enemy_health"
                   echo "The enemy attacks you. Your health: $player_health"
                   ;;
               "run")
                   echo "You run away!"
                   return
                   ;;
               *)
                   echo "Invalid action."
                   ;;
           esac
       done

       if [ $player_health -le 0 ]; then
           echo "You have been defeated."
       else
           echo "You defeated the enemy!"
       fi
   }
   ```

### Step 4: Polish and Expand

1. **Enhance User Interface:**
   Improve the display and user interface to make the game more visually appealing. Use ASCII art for maps and objects.

2. **Add More Interactions and Puzzles:**
   Introduce complex puzzles and more interactive elements to keep the game engaging.

3. **Create a Comprehensive Tutorial:**
   Provide a detailed tutorial at the beginning to help new players understand the game mechanics.

4. **Test and Iterate:**
   Continuously test your game and gather feedback. Use this feedback to make iterative improvements.

### Example Directory Structure

```
bashrun/
├── maps/
│   ├── level1.txt
│   ├── level2.txt
├── scripts/
│   ├── level1.sh
│   ├── level2.sh
│   ├── common.sh  # Contains common functions like inventory and combat
├── resources/
│   ├── ascii_art/
│   ├── items.txt
├── savefile.txt
└── README.md
```

### Example `common.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Inventory system
inventory=()

function add_to_inventory {
    inventory+=("$1")
    echo "$1 added to your inventory."
}

function show_inventory {
    echo "Your inventory: ${inventory[@]}"
}

# Combat system
function combat {
    local enemy_health=10
    local player_health=20

    echo "You encounter an enemy!"

    while [ $enemy_health -gt 0 ] && [ $player_health -gt 0 ]; do
        echo "Choose an action: [attack/run]"
        read action
        case $action in
            "attack")
                enemy_health=$((enemy_health - 2))
                player_health=$((player_health - 1))
                echo "You attack the enemy. Enemy health: $enemy_health"
                echo "The enemy attacks you. Your health: $player_health"
                ;;
            "run")
                echo "You run away!"
                return
                ;;
            *)
                echo "Invalid action."
                ;;
        esac
    done

    if [ $player_health -le 0 ]; then
        echo "You have been defeated."
    else
        echo "You defeated the enemy!"
    fi
}

# Save/Load system
function save_game {
    echo "${inventory[@]}" > savefile.txt
    echo "Game saved."
}

function load_game {
    if [ -f savefile.txt ]; then
        inventory=($(cat savefile.txt))
        echo "Game loaded."
    else
        echo "No saved game found."
    fi
}
```
