## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 1: Entering the Digital Dungeon

*As you approach the ancient digital dungeon, you see mysterious symbols carved into the virtual stone. These are not random markings - they are the sacred commands that will guide you through this realm.*

Before beginning your adventure, familiarize yourself with these magical incantations:

|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `ls` | Reveals contents of current location | Discover rooms and items |
| `ls -F` | Shows file types with special symbols | Identify different entities |
| `cd [directory]` | Transports you to new location | Move between dungeon rooms |
| `pwd` | Reveals your current position | Know where you are |
| `cat [file]` | Reads scrolls and documents | Examine clues and stories |
| `less [file]` | Reads long texts page by page | Study detailed manuscripts |

### 🔍 Understanding the Mystical Symbols

When you cast `ls -F`, you'll see these magical markers:

- **/** - Portals to other chambers (directories)
- **\*** - Magical artifacts with power (executable files)
- **@** - Mystical links to distant realms (symbolic links)
