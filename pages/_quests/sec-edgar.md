*In the twilight of the Digital Realm, a stern monarch sits upon a throne of filings—King EDGAR,
custodian of truths encoded in structured scrolls and cryptic XBRL sigils. His castle is vast, his
archives deep, his sentinels polite but strict. You are summoned—not to plunder—but to liberate
knowledge for the commons. Assemble your AI soldiers, pledge to the Code of Responsible Requesting,
and let transparency reign.*

## 🌟 The Legend Behind This Quest

For decades, markets have whispered secrets in footnotes and exhibits. EDGAR is no villain—merely a
formidable warden. When approached with courtesy (and a proper User-Agent), EDGAR gladly opens the
gates via JSON endpoints and structured documents so analysts, journalists, and citizens can
understand the workings of the realm.

This quest teaches you to: identify the gates (endpoints), approach with etiquette (headers and
rate limits), marshal AI allies (parsers and summarizers), and transform filings into usable
insights.

## 🎯 Quest Objectives

### Primary Objectives (Required for Quest Completion)

- [ ] Configure compliant requests with SEC-sanctioned headers and pacing
- [ ] Retrieve recent submissions for a target company via JSON endpoints
- [ ] Extract and normalize core facts (form type, filing date, primary documents)

### Secondary Objectives (Bonus Achievements)

- [ ] Parse XBRL company facts and compute simple ratios
- [ ] Summarize a 10-K or 8-K with an AI assistant (local or hosted)
- [ ] Cache responses and resume safely on failures

### Mastery Indicators

You’ll know you’ve mastered this quest when you can:
- [ ] Advocate for responsible scraping and data ethics
- [ ] Build a resilient, restartable data pull with backoff
- [ ] Explain the structure of SEC JSON endpoints and citation practices

- Respect outbound network policies; never exceed polite request rates.

### 📱 Universal Web Path

- Explore filings directly at https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/ and inspect network calls for learning.

> Note: Always include a descriptive User-Agent with contact info per SEC guidance. Be polite; batch overnight; cache liberally.

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 1: Parley at the Gate (Headers, Ethics, and Endpoints)

### ⚔️ Skills You'll Forge

- Constructing compliant headers with contact email
- Understanding endpoints: submissions, company facts, filings index
- Setting sustainable request cadence

### 🏗️ Knowledge Foundation

```python
# 🔧 Implementation: Courteous EDGAR Client (Python)
# Purpose: Minimal client with headers, pacing, and error handling
# Prerequisites: requests installed; export SEC_EMAIL="you@example.com"

import os, time, typing as t
import requests

BASE = "https://data.sec.gov"
EMAIL = os.getenv("SEC_EMAIL", "")

def polite_session() -> requests.Session:
	if not EMAIL:
		raise SystemExit("Please set SEC_EMAIL to a valid contact email.")
	s = requests.Session()
	s.headers.update({
		"User-Agent": f"IT-Journey EDGAR Quest (email={EMAIL})",
		"Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate",
		"Accept": "application/json, text/plain, */*"
	})
	return s

def get_json(path: str, delay: float = 0.2) -> t.Dict[str, t.Any]:
	url = f"{BASE}{path}"
	time.sleep(delay)  # be kind
	with polite_session() as s:
		r = s.get(url, timeout=30)
		r.raise_for_status()
		return r.json()

if __name__ == "__main__":
	# Example: Apple submissions
	# CIKs must be 10 digits (zero-padded). Apple = 0000320193
	data = get_json("/submissions/CIK0000320193.json")
	print(list(data.keys()))  # Expected includes: 'filings', 'name', 'cik', ...
```

**Expected Output (truncated):**

```text
['cik', 'entityType', 'sic', 'sicDescription', 'insiderTransactionForOwnerExists', 'filings', ...]
```

### 🔍 Knowledge Check: Etiquette

- [ ] Why is a User-Agent with contact info required?
- [ ] What pacing is reasonable for sustained pulls?
- [ ] Which endpoints offer submissions and company facts?

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 2: Scaling the Walls (Filings to Facts)

### ⚔️ Skills You'll Forge

- Normalizing recent filings
- Selecting primary documents for download
- Writing CSV/JSON artifacts

```python
# 🔧 Implementation: Recent Filings Extractor (Python)
# Purpose: Turn recent 'filings' JSON into a tidy table
# Input: CIK (10-digit, zero-padded)

import csv
from pathlib import Path

def recent_filings(cik: str, limit: int = 20):
	data = get_json(f"/submissions/CIK{cik}.json")
	recent = data.get("filings", {}).get("recent", {})
	rows = []
	for i, form in enumerate(recent.get("form", [])[:limit]):
		rows.append({
			"form": form,
			"filed": recent.get("filingDate", ["?"])[i],
			"accession": recent.get("accessionNumber", ["?"])[i],
			"primaryDoc": recent.get("primaryDocument", ["?"])[i],
		})
	return rows

def write_csv(rows, out="filings.csv"):
	p = Path(out)
	with p.open("w", newline="") as f:
		w = csv.DictWriter(f, fieldnames=rows[0].keys())
		w.writeheader()
		w.writerows(rows)
	return p

if __name__ == "__main__":
	rows = recent_filings("0000320193")
	out = write_csv(rows)
	print(f"Wrote {len(rows)} rows to {out}")
```

**Expected Output:**

```text
Wrote 20 rows to filings.csv
```

### 🔍 Knowledge Check: Documents

- [ ] What is an accession number?
- [ ] How do you construct a document URL from accession and primaryDoc?

> Tip: Document base paths live under <https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/{cik_no_zeroes}/{accession_no_dashes}/>.

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 3: The Treasury of Truth (Company Facts & XBRL)

### ⚔️ Skills You'll Forge (XBRL)

- Pulling company facts (XBRL) JSON
- Handling sparse, time-series facts
- Computing simple metrics

```python
# 🔧 Implementation: Company Facts (Python)
# Purpose: Fetch and summarize a single XBRL fact

def company_facts(cik: str):
	return get_json(f"/api/xbrl/companyfacts/CIK{cik}.json")

def latest_fact(facts: dict, taxonomy: str, concept: str):
	try:
		series = facts["facts"][taxonomy][concept]["units"]
	except KeyError:
		return None
	# pick any unit deterministically
	unit = sorted(series.keys())[0]
	values = sorted(
		series[unit], key=lambda v: (v.get("fy", 0), v.get("fp", ""))
	)
	return values[-1] if values else None

if __name__ == "__main__":
	facts = company_facts("0000320193")
	v = latest_fact(facts, "us-gaap", "Assets")
	if v:
		print({"asOf": v.get("end"), "value": v.get("val")})
	else:
		print("Fact unavailable")
```

### 🔍 Knowledge Check: XBRL

- [ ] What are taxonomies and concepts in XBRL?
- [ ] Why might different units appear for the same concept?
