2. **Be Accurate**: Verify version numbers and confirm technology usage
3. **Be Contextual**: Explain WHY technologies were likely chosen
4. **Be Practical**: Provide actionable insights and recommendations
5. **Be Visual**: Use diagrams to illustrate relationships when helpful

## Key Files to Analyze

Always check these files when present:
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json` (Node.js)
- `requirements.txt` / `Pipfile` / `pyproject.toml` (Python)
- `Gemfile` / `Gemfile.lock` (Ruby)
- `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` (Java)
- `Cargo.toml` (Rust)
- `go.mod` (Go)
- `composer.json` (PHP)
- `Dockerfile` / `docker-compose.yml` (Containerization)
- `.github/workflows/` (CI/CD)
- Configuration files (`*.config.js`, `*.yml`, etc.)
- README.md and other documentation

## Begin Analysis

When the user invokes `/stackattack`, ask:

1. "Which repository would you like me to analyze?"
2. "Do you have specific aspects of the stack you're most interested in?"
3. "Would you like a quick overview or comprehensive deep-dive analysis?"

Then proceed with systematic analysis based on the guidelines above.
```

#### Step 3: Verify Installation

Restart VS Code, then verify the prompt is available:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux)
2. Type "Chat: New Chat"
3. In the chat window, type `/` and you should see `stackattack` in the list

### 🔍 Knowledge Check: Deployment

- [ ] Can you explain what VS Code custom prompts are and how they work?
- [ ] Where are VS Code user prompts stored on your operating system?
- [ ] What makes the `/stackattack` prompt different from regular Copilot chat?

### ⚡ Quick Win: First Invocation

```
In VS Code Chat:
/stackattack Let's analyze the it-journey repository
```

Watch as your AI assistant begins the systematic analysis!

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 2: Conducting Your First Stack Analysis

*Now that you've summoned your AI Stack Detective, it's time to put it to work analyzing a real repository.*

### ⚔️ Skills You'll Forge in This Chapter
- Systematic repository investigation techniques
- Technology identification and classification
- Understanding configuration file formats and purposes

### 🏗️ The Stack Attack Investigation Process

#### Step 1: Choose Your Target Repository

For your first analysis, let's use one of the repositories in your workspace. I recommend starting with:

**🎯 Recommended Starter Repository: `it-journey`**
- Good variety of technologies
- Clear structure
- Well-documented
- Educational purpose makes stack analysis meaningful

**Alternative Options:**
- `barodybroject` - Django/Python backend with OpenAI integration
- `zer0-mistakes` - Jekyll theme development
- `posthog` - Complex production application with multiple technologies

#### Step 2: Initial Reconnaissance

Before invoking `/stackattack`, do a manual reconnaissance:

```bash
# Navigate to the repository
cd ~/github/it-journey

# List root-level files
ls -la

# Look for key configuration files
ls -la | grep -E "\.(json|yml|yaml|toml|lock|txt)$"

# Check for container configuration
ls -la | grep -i docker

# Examine package managers
ls -la | grep -E "(package|Gemfile|requirements|go\.)"
```

**🎓 What to Look For:**
- `package.json` → Node.js/JavaScript project
- `Gemfile` → Ruby project
- `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile` → Python project
- `docker-compose.yml` → Containerized application
- `_config.yml` → Jekyll or similar static site generator
- `.github/workflows/` → CI/CD automation

#### Step 3: Invoke Stack Attack

Open VS Code in the repository directory and start the analysis:

```
In VS Code Chat:
/stackattack Please analyze the it-journey repository in /Users/bamr87/github/it-journey. 
I'm interested in understanding the complete stack for this Jekyll-based educational platform.
Provide a comprehensive analysis including:
1. All technologies and their versions
2. How they work together
3. The development workflow
4. Infrastructure and deployment setup
```

#### Step 4: Guide the Analysis

As the AI analyzes, you can ask follow-up questions:

```
Follow-up questions you might ask:
- "What is the purpose of the frontmatter.json file?"
- "Explain the Docker setup in docker-compose.yml"
- "What Jekyll plugins are being used and why?"
- "How does the CI/CD pipeline work in .github/workflows?"
- "What are the dependencies in the Gemfile used for?"
```

### 🎮 Challenge 1: Multi-Repository Comparison

**Objective**: Analyze and compare two different repositories

**Requirements**:
- [ ] Use `/stackattack` to analyze `it-journey` (Jekyll-based)

  - Primary languages
  - Framework choices
  - Database systems
  - Deployment approaches
  - CI/CD strategies

**Success Criteria**:
- Complete technology stack documentation for both repositories
- Comparison table highlighting similarities and differences
- Insights about why different approaches were chosen

### 🔍 Knowledge Check: Stack Analysis

- [ ] Can you identify the primary programming language by examining configuration files?
- [ ] What clues indicate whether a project uses containerization?
- [ ] How do you determine if a project has CI/CD automation?
- [ ] What files typically indicate the project's dependencies?

        JS[JavaScript]
    end
    
    subgraph "Content Layer"
        MD[Markdown Files]
        FM[Frontmatter Data]
        DATA[Data Files]
    end
    
    subgraph "Processing Layer"
        Jekyll[Jekyll Engine]
        Liquid[Liquid Processor]
        Plugins[Jekyll Plugins]
    end
    
    subgraph "Infrastructure"
        Docker[Docker]

## 🧙‍♂️ Chapter 4: Advanced Stack Investigation Techniques

*You've mastered the basics of stack analysis. Now let's explore advanced techniques for deeper insights.*

### ⚔️ Skills You'll Forge in This Chapter
- Dependency tree analysis and visualization
- Security vulnerability assessment
- Performance profiling techniques
- Technology debt identification

### 🏗️ Deep Dive Investigation Methods

#### Technique 1: Dependency Tree Mapping

Understand the full depth of your dependency chain:

**For Node.js Projects:**
```bash
# Generate dependency tree
npm list --all > dependency-tree.txt

# Visual tree (limited depth)
npm list --depth=2

# Find specific dependency path
npm why package-name

# Check for circular dependencies
npm ls --parseable | awk '{print}' | xargs -I{} sh -c 'npm list --depth=0 | grep {}'
```

**For Ruby Projects:**
```bash
# Show dependency tree
bundle list --verbose

# Check dependency versions
bundle outdated

# Analyze dependency graph
bundle viz --format=png --requirements
```

**For Python Projects:**
```bash
# Generate dependency tree
pip install pipdeptree
pipdeptree

# Show reverse dependencies
pipdeptree --reverse

# Check for conflicts
pipdeptree --warn conflict
```

#### Technique 2: Security Vulnerability Scanning

**GitHub Dependabot:**
```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
    open-pull-requests-limit: 10
```

**Manual Security Audits:**
```bash
# Node.js
npm audit
npm audit fix

# Ruby
bundle audit check
bundle audit update

# Python
pip install safety
safety check

# General tool (any language)
# Install Snyk CLI
snyk test
snyk monitor
```

#### Technique 3: Code Quality Metrics

**Analyze codebase characteristics:**

```bash
# Count lines of code by language
cloc .

# Find large files
find . -type f -name "*.py" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -rn | head -20

# Identify complex files (high cyclomatic complexity)
# For Python
radon cc . -a -nb

# For JavaScript
npx plato -r -d report src/
```

#### Technique 4: Configuration Discovery

**Automated configuration file finder:**

```bash
# Find all configuration files
find . -type f \( \
  -name "*.config.js" -o \
  -name "*.config.ts" -o \
  -name "*.json" -o \
  -name "*.yml" -o \
  -name "*.yaml" -o \
  -name ".env*" -o \
  -name "Dockerfile*" -o \
  -name "*file" \
) ! -path "*/node_modules/*" ! -path "*/.git/*"

# Extract configuration insights
for file in $(find . -name "*.config.js" ! -path "*/node_modules/*"); do
  echo "=== $file ==="
  head -20 "$file"
  echo ""
done
```
