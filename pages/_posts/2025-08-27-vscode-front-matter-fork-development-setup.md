‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # Project documentation
```

### Step 6: Build System Overview

**Objective**: Understand the multi-target build system

**Build Targets**:

- **Extension**: The core VS Code extension (`src/extension.ts`)
- **Dashboard**: React-based CMS interface (`src/dashboard/`)
- **Panel**: Side panel React components (`src/panels/`)

**Key npm Scripts**:

```bash
# Development with hot reload
npm run dev:ext           # Start all development servers

# Individual builds
npm run dev:build:ext     # Build extension only
npm run dev:build:dashboard  # Build dashboard only
npm run dev:build:panel   # Build panel only

# Production builds
npm run vscode:prepublish # Full production build
npm run prod:ext         # Production extension build

# Utilities
npm run clean            # Clean dist directory
npm run lint             # Run ESLint
npm run prettier         # Format code
```

---

## ‚ö° Phase 3: Development Workflow Setup

### Step 7: Start Development Environment

**Objective**: Launch the complete development environment with hot-reload

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Start the development environment
npm run dev:ext
```

**What This Does**:

1. **Cleans** the `dist/` directory
2. **Generates** localization files
3. **Starts** three parallel processes:
   - Extension build with watch mode
   - Dashboard development server (<http://localhost:9000/>)
   - Panel development server (<http://localhost:9001/>)

**Expected Output**:

```text
> vscode-front-matter-beta@10.9.0 dev:ext
> npm run clean && npm run localization:generate && npm-run-all --parallel watch:*

<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:9000/
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:9001/

extension (webpack 5.90.1) compiled successfully
dashboard (webpack 5.90.1) compiled successfully  
panel (webpack 5.90.1) compiled successfully
```

### Step 8: Test Extension in Development Mode

**Objective**: Verify the extension loads and functions correctly

**Implementation**:

1. **Launch Extension Development Host**:
   - Press `F5` in VS Code **OR**
   - Go to Run and Debug (`Cmd+Shift+D`)
   - Select "Launch Extension" and click the play button

2. **Verify Extension Loading**:

   ```text
   # In the Extension Development Host window:
   # Press Cmd+Shift+P (macOS) or Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux)
   # Type: "Front Matter"
   # You should see multiple Front Matter commands
   ```

3. **Test Core Functionality**:
   - **Dashboard Access**: Command "Front Matter: Open dashboard"
   - **Panel Access**: Look for Front Matter icon in sidebar
   - **Direct URLs**:
     - Dashboard: <http://localhost:9000/>
     - Panel: <http://localhost:9001/>

**Success Criteria**:

- [ ] Extension Development Host opens without errors
- [ ] Front Matter commands appear in Command Palette
- [ ] Dashboard opens and displays interface
- [ ] Panel loads in sidebar
- [ ] Development servers respond on ports 9000 and 9001

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 4: Development and Testing Workflow

### Step 9: Making Your First Change

**Objective**: Understand the development workflow by making a simple modification

**Example Change - Add a Custom Command**:

1. **Create a New Command File**:
   ```typescript
   // src/commands/myCustomCommand.ts
   import { window } from 'vscode';
   
   export const myCustomCommand = () => {
     window.showInformationMessage('Hello from my custom Front Matter command!');
   };
   ```

2. **Register the Command**:
   ```typescript
   // In src/extension.ts (find the activate function)
   import { myCustomCommand } from './commands/myCustomCommand';
   
   // Add to the commands registration section:
   const myCustomCmd = commands.registerCommand('frontMatter.myCustomCommand', myCustomCommand);
   subscriptions.push(myCustomCmd);
   ```

3. **Add Command to Package.json**:
   ```json
   // In package.json, find the "contributes.commands" section
   {
     "command": "frontMatter.myCustomCommand",
     "title": "My Custom Command",
     "category": "Front Matter"
   }
   ```

### Step 10: Testing Changes

**Objective**: Verify your modifications work correctly

**Testing Process**:

1. **Automatic Rebuild**: Webpack watch mode automatically rebuilds when you save files

2. **Reload Extension**: In the Extension Development Host:
   - Press `Cmd+R` (macOS) or `Ctrl+R` (Windows/Linux)
   - Or use Command Palette: "Developer: Reload Window"

3. **Test Your Change**:
   ```
   # In Extension Development Host:
   # Cmd+Shift+P ‚Üí "Front Matter: My Custom Command"
   # Should show your custom message
   ```

**Debugging Tips**:
- **Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints in your TypeScript source files
- **Console Logging**: Use `console.log()` - output appears in the original VS Code's Debug Console
- **Error Inspection**: Check the Developer Tools in Extension Development Host (`Help ‚Üí Toggle Developer Tools`)

### Step 11: Working with Dashboard and Panel

**Objective**: Understand how to modify the React-based interfaces

**Dashboard Development**:
```bash
# Dashboard runs at http://localhost:9000/
# Source files in: src/dashboard/
# Main entry point: src/dashboard/index.tsx
```

**Panel Development**:
```bash
# Panel runs at http://localhost:9001/  
# Source files in: src/panels/
# Main entry point: src/panels/index.tsx
```

**Hot Reload**: Both dashboard and panel support hot module replacement - changes appear immediately in the browser.

```bash
# Generate localization enum
npm run localization:generate

# Find missing localization keys
npm run localization:find

# Sync localization files
npm run localization:sync
```

**Adding New Localizable Strings**:
1. Add key to `package.nls.json`
2. Add translations to language-specific files (`package.nls.de.json`, etc.)
3. Use in code: `vscode.l10n.t('your.key')`

### Step 14: Testing Strategies

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive testing for your changes

**Testing Approaches**:

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual functions and components
2. **Integration Testing**: Test command interactions and workflows  
3. **Manual Testing**: Test in real VS Code environment
4. **User Scenario Testing**: Test complete user workflows

**Test File Structure**:
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myCommand.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ myCommand.test.ts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ helper.ts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ __tests__/
