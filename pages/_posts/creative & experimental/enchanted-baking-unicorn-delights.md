[Opening shot of a beautiful enchanted forest with a sparkling rainbow in the background. The camera pans to a cozy cottage where three unicorn chefs, Sparkle, Rainbow, and Stardust, are gathered in the kitchen, surrounded by an array of colorful ingredients.]

Host Unicorn (Sparkle): Welcome to the Magical Unicorn Kitchen! Today, we are going to show you how to make the most delicious and beautiful Rainbow Cupcakes. Are you ready, chefs?

Unicorn Chef Rainbow: Ready!

Unicorn Chef Stardust: Ready!

Host Unicorn (Sparkle): Let's get started! First, we need to mix the batter. Rainbow, can you add the flour, sugar, and milk into the mixing bowl?

Unicorn Chef Rainbow carefully adds the ingredients into the mixing bowl, creating a magical swirl of colors as she mixes them together with her horn.

Host Unicorn (Sparkle): Stardust, can you add a hint of magic sparkles to the batter for that extra special touch?

Unicorn Chef Stardust sprinkles a dash of shimmering magic sparkles into the batter, making it glow with enchantment.

Host Unicorn (Sparkle): Now, we need to divide the batter into six different bowls and add a different color to each one. Rainbow, can you add the colors of the rainbow to the bowls?

Unicorn Chef Rainbow dips her horn into each bowl, magically adding a different color to each one - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

Host Unicorn (Sparkle): Now, let's spoon the colored batter into the cupcake liners, layering them to create a rainbow effect. Stardust, can you help with this?

Unicorn Chef Stardust carefully layers the colored batter into the cupcake liners, creating a beautiful rainbow pattern with each scoop.

Host Unicorn (Sparkle): And now, we bake the cupcakes in the enchanted oven for a touch of unicorn magic. While the cupcakes are baking, let's prepare the frosting. Rainbow, can you whip up a colorful and fluffy frosting for our cupcakes?

Unicorn Chef Rainbow whips up a fluffy and colorful frosting using a mix of rainbow sprinkles and magic dust, creating a spectacular swirl of colors.

Host Unicorn (Sparkle): And there you have it, our magical Rainbow Cupcakes are ready! Let's sprinkle some extra magic on top and serve them to our enchanted guests.

[The unicorns present the dazzling Rainbow Cupcakes to a group of forest animals who exclaim in delight at the sight.]

Host Unicorn (Sparkle): Thank you for joining us in the Magical Unicorn Kitchen! Join us next time for more enchanting recipes and mystical delights. Until then, stay magical!
