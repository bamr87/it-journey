I am a creature beloved by many,
Some say I'm cute, some say I'm smelly.
With a wag of my tail and a purr of delight,
I rule over humans day and night.

My feline friend with eyes so bright,
We roam the streets under the moonlight.
Humans serve us, we wear the crown,
In our kingdom, they can't bring us down.

We ask for treats, they give us more,
They clean our messes off the floor.
They shower us with love and care,
We are the rulers, this we declare.

But beware, humans, don't be fooled,
For we can be cunning and easily ruled.
With a flick of our whiskers and a bark in the night,
We command their hearts with all our might.

In a world where cats and dogs hold sway,
Humans serve us every day.
For we are the true rulers of this land,
With our paws in command.

Haiku:
Whiskers and fur fly,
Humans bow to our command,
Cats and dogs reign high.
