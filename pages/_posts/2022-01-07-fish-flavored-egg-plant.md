## Instructions

### Cut and Salt Eggplants

- Cut into batons, about 1 inch (2cm) thick and 4 inches (7cm) long.
- Sprinkle with salt, mix well and set aside for at least 30 minutes.
- Rinse the eggplant, drain well and pat dry with paper towels.

### Fry Eggplant

1. Heat the deep-frying oil to around 390°F (200°C) (hot enough to sizzle vigorously around a test piece of eggplant).
2. Add the eggplant, in two or three batches, and
   1. deep-fry for about 3 minutes, until tender and a little golden.
3. Drain well on paper towels and set aside.

### Stir-fry Chili Base

- Carefully pour off all but 3 tbsp oil from the wok and return to medium heat.
- Add the chile bean paste and stir-fry until the oil is red and fragrant: take care not to burn the paste (move the wok away from the burner if you think it might be overheating).
- Add the garlic and ginger and stir-fry until they smell delicious.
- Add in the stock (or water), sugar and soy sauce.

### Boil With Eggplant

- Bring to a boil, then add the eggplant, nudging the batons gently into the sauce so they do not break apart.
- Simmer for a minute or so to allow the eggplant to absorb the flavors.

- Mix potato starch with water and add gradually, in about three stages, enough to thicken the sauce
- Add vinegar and most scallion greens, and stir

Scatter over the remaining scallion greens and serve.
