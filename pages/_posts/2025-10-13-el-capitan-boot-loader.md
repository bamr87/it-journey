## Introduction

If you've tried to create a bootable OS X El Capitan installer on a modern Apple Silicon Mac, you've likely encountered frustrating compatibility errors. The legacy installer package includes architecture checks that prevent installation on ARM-based systems or macOS versions newer than 10.11. This technical barrier can feel like a roadblock when you need to restore or upgrade an older Intel-based Mac.

Fortunately, you can bypass these limitations by manually extracting and processing the installer files directly from the DMG. This guide demonstrates how to use built-in macOS tools like `pkgutil`, `hdiutil`, and `asr` (Apple Software Restore) to build a complete bootable installer without running the incompatible installer application.

### 🌟 Why This Matters

Legacy Mac systems (2006-2010 era) often require older operating systems like El Capitan for optimal performance or compatibility with specific software. Whether you're:
- Restoring a vintage Mac to working condition
- Supporting legacy hardware in educational or professional environments
- Archiving and preserving older systems
- Working with software that requires El Capitan specifically

...this technique enables you to create proper installation media from modern hardware.

### 🎯 What You'll Learn

By following this guide, you'll be able to:
- Extract installer components from DMG files manually
- Manipulate disk images using `hdiutil` for custom bootable media
- Restore images to physical media using Apple Software Restore
- Understand the architecture and structure of macOS installers
- Troubleshoot common issues in the extraction and restoration process

### 📋 Before We Begin

**Important Warnings:**
- ⚠️ This process will **completely erase** your SD card or USB drive
- 📦 Back up any existing data before proceeding
- 💾 Requires at least 8GB of storage on your target media
- 🖥️ Intended for restoring Intel-based Macs (2006-2010 models)
- 🔐 Requires administrator privileges on your Mac

**What You'll Need:**
- Modern Apple Silicon Mac (M1 or later)
- OS X El Capitan installer DMG (typically named "InstallMacOSX.dmg")
- 8GB+ SD card or USB drive
- 15-20 minutes of time

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Preparation and Environment Setup

### Verify Your Installation Media

First, ensure you have the correct El Capitan installer file:

1. **Locate the DMG**: Your El Capitan installer should be named "InstallMacOSX.dmg" or similar, typically in your Downloads folder
2. **Verify integrity**: Check the file size (approximately 6.2 GB for the complete installer)
3. **Source verification**: Ensure you obtained the installer from Apple's official support site

### Prepare Your SD Card or USB Drive

⚠️ **Critical Step**: This process completely erases your target media. Back up any existing data first.

#### Using Disk Utility

1. **Insert your media**: Connect the SD card (via card reader if needed) or USB drive to your Mac
2. **Open Disk Utility**: 
   - Navigate to `Applications > Utilities > Disk Utility`
   - Or press `⌘ + Space`, type "Disk Utility", and press Enter
3. **Select the device**: 
   - In the sidebar, select the **top-level device** (not a partition)
   - Look for the physical device name (e.g., "Generic SD Card" or "USB Drive")
4. **Erase and format**:
   - Click the **Erase** button in the toolbar
   - Configure the following settings:
     - **Name**: `SDCard` (or any simple name without spaces)
     - **Format**: `Mac OS Extended (Journaled)`
     - **Scheme**: `GUID Partition Map` (critical for Intel Mac booting)
   - Click **Erase** and wait for completion
5. **Verify**: The formatted volume should now appear in Finder under `/Volumes/SDCard`

#### Quick Terminal Alternative

If you prefer the command line, identify your device first:

```bash
# List all disks (identify your SD card carefully!)
diskutil list
```

Then erase it (replace `diskX` with your actual disk identifier):

```bash
# DANGER: This erases the entire disk
sudo diskutil eraseDisk JHFS+ SDCard GPT /dev/diskX
```

## 🔧 Phase 2: Extract Installer Components

This phase bypasses the compatibility checks by manually extracting the installer payload without running the incompatible installer application.

### Step 1: Mount the Installer DMG

**Objective**: Access the installer package files

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Mount the El Capitan installer DMG
hdiutil attach ~/Downloads/InstallMacOSX.dmg -noverify -nobrowse
```

**Expected Result**: A volume named "OS X El Capitan Install" (or similar) appears in Finder

**What's Happening**: The `-noverify` flag speeds up mounting by skipping checksum verification, while `-nobrowse` prevents the volume from appearing in Finder windows (though it's still accessible).

### Step 2: Copy the Installer Package

**Objective**: Extract the installer package to a working location

**Via Finder**:
1. Open Finder and locate the mounted volume "OS X El Capitan Install"
2. Drag the `InstallMacOSX.pkg` file to your Desktop

**Via Terminal** (faster):

```bash
# Copy the installer package to Desktop
cp /Volumes/Install\ OS\ X\ El\ Capitan/InstallMacOSX.pkg ~/Desktop/
```

### Step 3: Expand the Package Archive

**Objective**: Extract the package contents without running the installer

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Open Terminal if not already open
# Navigate to Desktop
cd ~/Desktop

# Expand the .pkg file into a directory structure
pkgutil --expand InstallMacOSX.pkg Installer
```

**Expected Result**: A new folder named `Installer` appears on your Desktop containing the unpacked package structure

**Understanding pkgutil**: The `--expand` option flattens the package structure, making individual components accessible without installation.

### Step 4: Extract the Payload

**Objective**: Unpack the compressed payload containing the actual installer files

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Navigate into the expanded package
cd ~/Desktop/Installer/InstallMacOSX.pkg

# Extract the tar-compressed payload
tar -xvf Payload
```

**Expected Result**: You'll see extraction progress for numerous files. The `-xvf` flags mean:
- `x`: Extract files
- `v`: Verbose output (show file names)
- `f`: Read from file (not stdin)

**Troubleshooting**: If you see "No such file or directory", verify you're in the correct directory with `pwd` (should show `/Users/[yourname]/Desktop/Installer/InstallMacOSX.pkg`)

### Step 5: Locate the Essential Installer Image

**Objective**: Find and extract the `InstallESD.dmg` file, which contains the actual OS installation files

**Implementation**:

```bash
# The extracted files create an Applications directory structure
# Move the critical InstallESD.dmg to Desktop for easier access
mv InstallESD.dmg ~/Desktop/

# Alternative: Find it if the structure differs
find ~/Desktop/Installer -name "InstallESD.dmg" -exec mv {} ~/Desktop/ \;
```

**Expected Result**: `InstallESD.dmg` now exists on your Desktop (approximately 6 GB)

### Step 6: Cleanup Initial Extraction

**Objective**: Free up disk space and unmount the original installer

```bash
# Eject the original mounted DMG
hdiutil detach "/Volumes/Install OS X El Capitan"

# Optional: Remove the expanded package to save space
rm -rf ~/Desktop/Installer
```

**What We've Accomplished**: You now have the core installer image (`InstallESD.dmg`) extracted and ready for processing, without running any incompatible installer code.

## ⚡ Phase 3: Build the Bootable Image

This phase transforms the extracted installer into a complete, bootable disk image. We'll use a sparse image format for efficient manipulation before creating the final compressed image.

### Step 1: Mount the InstallESD Image

**Objective**: Access the base system files needed for booting

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Mount InstallESD.dmg to a specific location
hdiutil attach ~/Desktop/InstallESD.dmg -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_app
```

**Expected Result**: The image mounts silently at `/Volumes/install_app`

**Technical Note**: Custom mount points prevent conflicts if you have other volumes mounted and provide predictable paths for scripting.

### Step 2: Convert Base System to Sparse Image

**Objective**: Create a modifiable working copy of the base system

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Convert BaseSystem.dmg to a sparse (resizable) format
hdiutil convert /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg -format UDSP -o /tmp/Installer
```

**Expected Result**: Creates `/tmp/Installer.sparseimage` (approximately 2 GB initially)

**Why Sparse Images?**: Unlike standard DMG files, sparse images can grow dynamically as we add content, making them perfect for building custom installers.

### Step 3: Resize to Accommodate All Files

**Objective**: Expand the sparse image to hold the complete installer

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Resize to 8GB (sufficient for El Capitan installer)
hdiutil resize -size 8g /tmp/Installer.sparseimage
```

**Expected Result**: Image capacity increases to 8 GB without immediately using that disk space

**Troubleshooting**: If you see "Resource busy", ensure no other process is accessing the image. Use `lsof | grep Installer` to check.

### Step 4: Mount the Working Image

**Objective**: Access the sparse image to add installer components

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Mount the resized sparse image
hdiutil attach /tmp/Installer.sparseimage -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build
```

**Expected Result**: Mounted at `/Volumes/install_build`, ready for modification

### Step 5: Replace Placeholder Packages

**Objective**: Remove the symbolic link and add actual installer packages

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Remove the placeholder Packages symlink
rm -r /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/Packages

# Copy the complete package directory from the source
cp -av /Volumes/install_app/Packages /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/
```

**Expected Result**: Progress output showing copied files (approximately 5.5 GB)

**Understanding -av flags**:
- `a`: Archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps, etc.)
- `v`: Verbose output (shows what's being copied)

**Troubleshooting**: If the copy fails with "Operation not permitted", ensure Terminal has Full Disk Access:
- System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access
- Enable Terminal

### Step 6: Copy Essential Boot Files

**Objective**: Add the files needed for the installer to boot correctly

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Copy the chunklist verification file
cp -av /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.chunklist /Volumes/install_build/

# Copy the base system image
cp -av /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg /Volumes/install_build/
```

**Expected Result**: Two additional files copied to the root of the installer

**What Are These Files?**:
- `BaseSystem.chunklist`: Cryptographic verification data for secure boot
- `BaseSystem.dmg`: The minimal system needed to boot and run the installer

### Step 7: Unmount All Working Volumes

**Objective**: Safely detach volumes before finalizing the image

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Unmount the source installer
hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_app

# Unmount the working sparse image
hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_build
```

**Expected Result**: Both volumes disappear from Finder and `/Volumes/`

**Why This Matters**: Unmounting ensures all file buffers are flushed to disk and prevents corruption.

### Step 8: Optimize Image Size

**Objective**: Shrink the sparse image to its minimum required size

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Calculate minimum size and resize
hdiutil resize -size $(hdiutil resize -limits /tmp/Installer.sparseimage | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1}')b /tmp/Installer.sparseimage
```

**Expected Result**: Image size reduces to approximately 6.2 GB (just enough for the content)

**Command Breakdown**:
- `hdiutil resize -limits`: Reports minimum, current, and maximum sizes
- `tail -n 1`: Gets the last line (the actual numbers)
- `awk '{print $1}'`: Extracts the first column (minimum size in sectors)
- `b`: Appends 'b' to specify bytes

### Step 9: Create Final Compressed Image

**Objective**: Convert the sparse image to a compressed, efficient DMG

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Convert to compressed DMG format
hdiutil convert /tmp/Installer.sparseimage -format UDZO -o /tmp/Installer
```

**Expected Result**: Creates `/tmp/Installer.dmg` (approximately 5.8 GB compressed)

**Format Details**:
- `UDZO`: UDIF zlib-compressed (read-only, maximum compression)
- This format is optimal for distribution and restoration

### Step 10: Move to Accessible Location

**Objective**: Place the final installer image where it's easy to find

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Move the completed installer to Desktop
mv /tmp/Installer.dmg ~/Desktop/ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg
```

**Expected Result**: `ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg` now on your Desktop, ready to restore to physical media

**Cleanup** (optional):

```bash
# Remove the sparse image to free up space
rm /tmp/Installer.sparseimage
```

## 🚀 Phase 4: Restore to Physical Media

The final phase writes the bootable installer image to your SD card or USB drive using Apple Software Restore (ASR).

### Step 1: Verify Your Target Media

**Objective**: Confirm the target device is mounted and ready

**Implementation**:

```bash
# List all mounted volumes
ls -la /Volumes/

# Specifically check for your SD card
ls -la /Volumes/SDCard
```

**Expected Result**: You should see your formatted SD card listed (we named it "SDCard" earlier)

**Troubleshooting**: If not found:
- Check Finder to confirm the media is mounted
- Use `diskutil list` to see all devices
- Remount the media if necessary

### Step 2: Restore the Image Using ASR

**Objective**: Block-copy the bootable installer to physical media

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Restore the image to your SD card
sudo asr restore --source ~/Desktop/ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg --target /Volumes/SDCard --noprompt --noverify --erase
```

**You'll Be Asked For**: Your administrator password

**Expected Result**: 
- Progress updates showing data being copied
- Verification phase (even with `--noverify`, basic checks occur)
- Total time: 10-20 minutes depending on media speed

**Command Breakdown**:
- `sudo`: Required for low-level disk operations
- `asr restore`: Apple Software Restore in restore mode
- `--source`: Path to your bootable DMG
- `--target`: Destination volume (will be erased)
- `--noprompt`: Skips confirmation dialog (we're sure!)
- `--noverify`: Skips checksum verification (speeds up process)
- `--erase`: Ensures clean write to destination

**Progress Indicators**:
```
Validating target...done
Validating source...done
Retrieving scan information...done
Validating sizes...done
Restoring  ....10....20....30....40....50....60....70....80....90....100
Verifying  ....10....20....30....40....50....60....70....80....90....100
Restored target device is /Volumes/OS X Base System
```

### Step 3: Verify Successful Restoration

**Objective**: Confirm the bootable installer is properly written

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Check the renamed volume
ls -la /Volumes/

# Verify installer contents
ls -la "/Volumes/OS X Base System/"
```

**Expected Result**: 
- Volume renamed to "OS X Base System" (automatic during restoration)
- Contains system files including `System/`, `Library/`, `BaseSystem.dmg`, etc.

**Additional Verification** (optional):

```bash
# Check the volume's bootability
bless --info "/Volumes/OS X Base System" --getBless
```

This should show blessing information confirming the volume is bootable.

### Step 4: Safe Ejection

**Objective**: Properly unmount the media before physical removal

**Via Finder**:
1. Locate "OS X Base System" in Finder sidebar
2. Click the eject icon next to it
3. Wait for the volume to disappear

**Via Terminal**:

```bash
# Safely eject the volume
diskutil eject "/Volumes/OS X Base System"
```

**Expected Result**: Message confirming successful ejection

**Critical**: Always eject properly to prevent data corruption. Don't just pull out the media!

## 🧹 Phase 5: Cleanup and Testing

### Cleanup Working Files

**Objective**: Free up disk space by removing temporary files

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Remove the extracted installer files (if still present)
rm -rf ~/Desktop/Installer

# Remove the working DMG files
rm ~/Desktop/InstallESD.dmg
rm ~/Desktop/InstallMacOSX.pkg

# Optional: Keep the final bootable DMG for future use
# rm ~/Desktop/ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg
```

**Expected Result**: Approximately 12 GB of disk space freed

**Best Practice**: Keep `ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg` as a master copy for creating additional bootable media later.

### Testing the Bootable Installer

#### On Target Intel Mac (2009 or Compatible)

**Objective**: Verify the installer boots correctly on legacy hardware

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Insert the media** into your target Mac:
   - SD card in built-in slot
   - USB drive in any USB port

2. **Power on with boot menu**:
   - Power off the Mac completely
   - Press the power button
   - **Immediately** hold the `Option (⌥)` key
   - Keep holding until you see the Startup Manager

3. **Select the installer**:
   - Look for "OS X Base System" or an orange drive icon
   - Use arrow keys to highlight it
   - Press Enter or click the arrow below the icon

4. **Wait for boot**:
   - You'll see an Apple logo with progress bar
   - Boot time: 2-5 minutes (depends on media speed)
   - Eventually reaches OS X Utilities window

**Expected Result**: OS X Utilities menu with options:
- Restore From Time Machine Backup
- Reinstall OS X
- Get Help Online
- Disk Utility

**Success Indicators**:
- ✅ Boots without kernel panic
- ✅ Mouse/trackpad work correctly
- ✅ Can access Disk Utility
- ✅ Can view available target disks

#### Alternative Boot Methods

**Firmware Boot Picker** (if Option key doesn't work):

1. Power on while holding `Command (⌘) + Option (⌥) + O + F`
2. At the OpenFirmware prompt, type:
   ```
   boot usb0/disk@1:2,\\:tbxi
   ```
   Or try variations: `usb1`, `sd0`, etc.

**Target Disk Mode Test** (advanced):

1. Connect target Mac to another Mac via FireWire/Thunderbolt
2. Boot target Mac holding `T` key
3. Verify the installer appears as an external disk
4. Check folder structure matches expectations

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Issue 1: SD Card Not Recognized for Booting

**Symptoms**: SD card doesn't appear in Startup Manager

**Causes**: 
- Some 2009 Macs don't support SD card booting
- Firmware limitations on certain models

**Solutions**:
1. **Use USB drive instead**: Repeat process with USB drive (higher compatibility)
2. **Check Apple Support**: Verify your Mac model supports SD card booting
3. **Test the card**: Try the SD card in Disk Utility on a working Mac

**Command to check**:
```bash
# See if your Mac's model identifier supports SD boot
system_profiler SPHardwareDataType | grep "Model Identifier"
```

Then search Apple's support database for your specific model.

#### Issue 2: "Prohibited" Symbol on Boot

**Symptoms**: Circle with line through it (🚫) appears when booting

**Causes**:
- Corrupted installer files
- Incompatible Mac model
- Damaged boot files

**Solutions**:
1. **Re-create the installer**: Start the process fresh
2. **Verify source DMG**: Re-download from Apple if suspect
3. **Check target Mac**: Confirm El Capitan compatibility
   - Supported models: Late 2007 - Mid 2010 approximately
   - Check: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886

#### Issue 3: Kernel Panic During Boot

**Symptoms**: Multi-language panic message appears

**Causes**:
- Hardware incompatibility
- Bad RAM in target Mac
- Corrupted installer

**Solutions**:
1. **Test RAM**: Run Apple Hardware Test on target Mac
2. **Try different media**: USB vs SD card
3. **Reset NVRAM**: Boot holding `Command + Option + P + R`

#### Issue 4: Installer Hangs on Apple Logo

**Symptoms**: Progress bar freezes, Mac doesn't respond

**Causes**:
- Slow or failing media
- Bad sectors on SD card/USB
- Insufficient target Mac specs

**Solutions**:
1. **Wait longer**: First boot can take 10-15 minutes
2. **Use faster media**: Try USB 3.0 drive if available
3. **Check connections**: Ensure solid contact in ports

#### Issue 5: Permission Errors During Creation

**Symptoms**: "Operation not permitted" when copying files

**Causes**: Terminal lacks Full Disk Access

**Solutions**:
1. **Grant Terminal access**:
   - Open System Settings
   - Go to Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access
   - Click the lock icon, authenticate
   - Toggle Terminal ON
   - Restart Terminal and try again

2. **Alternative approach**:
   ```bash
   # Run with explicit sudo if needed
   sudo bash -c 'cp -av /source /destination'
   ```

## ✅ Validation and Success Criteria

### Verification Checklist

Before considering this project complete, verify:

- [ ] **Bootable media created**: SD card or USB properly restored
- [ ] **Boots on target Mac**: Successfully reaches OS X Utilities
- [ ] **Disk Utility accessible**: Can partition target drives
- [ ] **Installer runs**: Can proceed with OS installation
- [ ] **Installation completes**: Successfully installs El Capitan

### Testing on Actual Hardware

**Best Practice**: Test installation on a non-critical Mac first

1. **Prepare test target**:
   - Back up any existing data
   - Or use a blank/spare hard drive

2. **Full installation test**:
   - Boot from your installer media
   - Use Disk Utility to partition target drive
   - Run "Reinstall OS X" option
   - Complete installation (20-40 minutes)
   - Verify successful boot to Setup Assistant

### Virtual Machine Testing (Alternative)

If you have access to VMware Fusion or Parallels:

```bash
# Create VM with El Capitan support
# Configure VM to boot from your bootable DMG
# Test installer flow in isolated environment
```

**Note**: VM testing confirms image integrity but doesn't guarantee hardware compatibility.

## 💡 Understanding the Process: Technical Deep Dive

### Why Manual Extraction Is Necessary

Apple's installer packages include built-in compatibility checks that verify:
- **Architecture compatibility**: ARM vs Intel (x86_64)
- **OS version requirements**: Minimum and maximum macOS versions
- **Hardware requirements**: Specific Mac models and firmware

When you try to run `InstallMacOSX.pkg` on an Apple Silicon Mac, these checks fail because:
1. The package expects Intel architecture
2. Your Mac is running macOS 11+ (El Capitan is 10.11)
3. The installer binary itself is Intel-only

**Manual extraction bypasses these checks** by accessing the payload directly without running any verification code.

### The Role of Each File

Understanding what each component does helps troubleshoot issues:

| File/Component | Purpose | Critical? |
|----------------|---------|-----------|
| `InstallESD.dmg` | Complete installer image with all OS files | ✅ Essential |
| `BaseSystem.dmg` | Minimal bootable system that runs the installer | ✅ Essential |
| `BaseSystem.chunklist` | Cryptographic verification for secure boot | ✅ Essential |
| `Packages/` | Individual OS components and updates | ✅ Essential |
| `InstallMacOSX.pkg` | Wrapper with compatibility checks | ⚠️ Only for extraction |

### Image Format Deep Dive

**Sparse Images (UDSP)**:
- Dynamically allocated storage
- Only uses disk space for actual data
- Can grow and shrink as needed
- Perfect for building custom images

**Compressed Images (UDZO)**:
- Read-only, zlib-compressed format
- Maximum space efficiency
- Standard for distribution
- Requires decompression to modify

**Conversion Process**:
```
Read/Write DMG → Sparse Image → Modified Sparse → Compressed DMG
(BaseSystem.dmg) → (Working copy) → (Added packages) → (Final installer)
```

### ASR (Apple Software Restore) Explained

ASR performs block-level copying with several advantages:

1. **Bit-perfect restoration**: Exact sector-by-sector copy
2. **Partition table creation**: Sets up GUID/GPT correctly
3. **Blessing the system**: Marks the volume as bootable
4. **Metadata preservation**: Keeps all extended attributes

**Why not just copy files?**: Simple file copying misses:
- Boot sector information
- Partition scheme configuration
- Blessing data (what tells firmware the disk is bootable)
- Extended attributes and ACLs

## 🚀 Next Steps and Advanced Applications

### Creating Multiple Bootable Installers

Once you have `ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg`, you can easily create additional installers:

```bash
# Fast restoration to another drive (replace diskX)
sudo asr restore --source ~/Desktop/ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg \
  --target /Volumes/AnotherDrive --noprompt --erase
```

### Automating the Process

**Create a reusable script** (`make-elcapitan-installer.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Automated El Capitan Bootable Installer Creator
# Usage: ./make-elcapitan-installer.sh /path/to/InstallMacOSX.dmg

set -e  # Exit on any error

SOURCE_DMG="$1"
WORK_DIR="/tmp/elcapitan-build"
OUTPUT="$HOME/Desktop/ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg"

if [ -z "$SOURCE_DMG" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <path-to-InstallMacOSX.dmg>"
    exit 1
fi

echo "🚀 Starting El Capitan bootable installer creation..."

# Create work directory
mkdir -p "$WORK_DIR"
cd "$WORK_DIR"

# Mount source
echo "📦 Mounting source installer..."
hdiutil attach "$SOURCE_DMG" -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_source

# Extract package
echo "📂 Extracting installer package..."
pkgutil --expand /Volumes/install_source/InstallMacOSX.pkg "$WORK_DIR/Installer"
cd "$WORK_DIR/Installer/InstallMacOSX.pkg"
tar -xvf Payload

# Get InstallESD
echo "💾 Locating InstallESD.dmg..."
find . -name "InstallESD.dmg" -exec cp {} "$WORK_DIR/" \;

# Build bootable image
echo "🔨 Building bootable image..."
hdiutil attach "$WORK_DIR/InstallESD.dmg" -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_app
hdiutil convert /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.dmg -format UDSP -o "$WORK_DIR/Installer"
hdiutil resize -size 8g "$WORK_DIR/Installer.sparseimage"
hdiutil attach "$WORK_DIR/Installer.sparseimage" -noverify -nobrowse -mountpoint /Volumes/install_build

# Copy packages
echo "📦 Copying installer packages..."
rm -rf /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/Packages
cp -av /Volumes/install_app/Packages /Volumes/install_build/System/Installation/
cp -av /Volumes/install_app/BaseSystem.* /Volumes/install_build/

# Finalize
echo "✨ Finalizing image..."
hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_app
hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_build
hdiutil resize -size $(hdiutil resize -limits "$WORK_DIR/Installer.sparseimage" | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $1}')b "$WORK_DIR/Installer.sparseimage"
hdiutil convert "$WORK_DIR/Installer.sparseimage" -format UDZO -o "$OUTPUT"

# Cleanup
echo "🧹 Cleaning up..."
hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_source
rm -rf "$WORK_DIR"

echo "✅ Complete! Bootable installer: $OUTPUT"
```

**Make it executable and use**:

```bash
chmod +x make-elcapitan-installer.sh
./make-elcapitan-installer.sh ~/Downloads/InstallMacOSX.dmg
```

### Extending to Other Legacy macOS Versions

This technique works for other legacy macOS releases:

- **Mountain Lion (10.8)**: Same process
- **Mavericks (10.9)**: Same process
- **Yosemite (10.10)**: Same process
- **Sierra (10.12)**: Slightly different (uses `Install macOS Sierra.app`)

**For Sierra and later**, the installer is an app bundle, so adjust the extraction:

```bash
# For Sierra-style installers
cp -R "/Volumes/Install macOS Sierra/Install macOS Sierra.app" /Applications/
sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia \
  --volume /Volumes/SDCard --applicationpath /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Sierra.app
```

### Network Installation Option

For multiple Mac restorations, consider NetBoot:

1. **Set up macOS Server** (or compatible NetBoot server)
2. **Create NetInstall image** from your bootable DMG
3. **Boot target Macs** holding `N` key for network boot
4. **Install over network** (requires ethernet for older Macs)

### Creating Hybrid Installation Media

**Combine multiple installers** on one large USB drive:

```bash
# Partition the drive
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskX 2 GPT \
  JHFS+ "El Capitan" 8G \
  JHFS+ "Sierra" 8G

# Restore each partition
sudo asr restore --source ~/Desktop/ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg \
  --target /Volumes/El\ Capitan --noprompt --erase
sudo asr restore --source ~/Desktop/Sierra-Bootable.dmg \
  --target /Volumes/Sierra --noprompt --erase
```

**Result**: Single USB drive with multiple bootable partitions.

df -h

# 3. Verify Terminal permissions
ls -la ~/Desktop/InstallESD.dmg

# 4. Check target media is writable
diskutil info /Volumes/SDCard | grep "Read-Only"

# 5. Verify final image is valid
hdiutil verify ~/Desktop/ElCapitan-Bootable.dmg
```

### Error Code Reference

| Error Message | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| "Operation not permitted" | Permissions issue | Grant Terminal Full Disk Access |
| "Resource busy" | Volume in use | Unmount with `diskutil unmount` |
| "No such file or directory" | Wrong path | Verify path with `pwd` and `ls` |
| "Not enough space" | Insufficient disk space | Free up space or use external drive |
| "Invalid argument" | Syntax error | Check command syntax carefully |
| "Device not found" | Media not mounted | Check with `diskutil list` |

### Recovery Strategies

**If the process fails mid-way**:

1. **Unmount all volumes**:
   ```bash
   hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_app
   hdiutil detach /Volumes/install_build
   ```

2. **Clean up temp files**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /tmp/Installer*
   rm -rf ~/Desktop/Installer
   ```

3. **Start fresh**: Re-download the source DMG if suspect corruption

4. **Check system logs** for detailed errors:
   ```bash
   log show --predicate 'process == "hdiutil"' --last 10m
   ```
