# 100 Questions & Answers About Arab-Americans

## A Journalist's Guide

Like all people, Arab Americans are too often described in simplistic terms.
Although the Arab culture is one of the oldest on Earth, it is, in many parts of the United States, misunderstood.
There are no easy, one-size-fits-all answers.
Culture, language and religion are distinct qualities that act in different ways to connect Arabs, and to distinguish them from one another.

The differences that seem to separate Arab Americans from non-Arabs can be much smaller than the variations that at times differentiate them from one another.
It takes time to learn the issues and to understand them, but it is essential and rewarding for us to do that.
Misunderstanding ultimately hurts each one of us.

## Overview

**1. Who are Arab Americans?**

Arab Americans are U.S. citizens and permanent residents who trace their ancestry to or who immigrated from Arabic-speaking places in southwestern Asia and northern Africa, a region known as the Middle East.
Not all people in this region are Arabs.
Most Arab Americans were born in the United States.

As of 2025, discussions increasingly emphasize the community’s diversity, including people who identify within the broader Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) category.
The U.S. Census Bureau continues to classify MENA-origin individuals under “White,” while advocacy for a distinct MENA category persists because classification affects how communities are counted and represented.

**Note:** Some middle eastern Americans do not like to be called Arab. For example, many Maronites in Lebanon believe that because they trace their ancestry to the ancient Phoenicians, and have no ethnic roots in the Arabian Peninsula where the original pre-Islamic Arabic tribes hailed from, then they don't like to be collectively called "Arab Americans" (Personal Note).

Here are some articles that illustrate this line of thinking:

- The Non-Arab Identity of Lebanon
- Maronite Church In US Asks Members To Identify As "Syriac"
- Stop Highjacking Our Lebanese Heritage and Achievements- ALPAC
- Gubran Khalil is Lebanese Not Arab - American Maronite Union Letter to Powell

**2. How many Arab Americans are there?**

This is the subject of some debate.
Estimates vary because the U.S. Census Bureau does not use an Arab American classification and because people identify themselves in various ways.
Some Arab Americans identify themselves as Middle Eastern, for example.
Recent immigrants from many countries are reluctant to give personal and confidential information to the government, and an increasing number of people have more than one ethnicity.
Historically, estimates of Arab Americans living in the United States were about 3 million.

As of 2025, the Arab American Institute estimates approximately 3.7 million Arab Americans, accounting for underreporting in official counts.
The 2020 Census reported about 3.5 million people of MENA descent, with Lebanese, Iranian, and Egyptian among the largest subgroups.
Growth has been driven by immigration and higher birth rates, nearly quadrupling the population since 1980.


**3. Where do Arab Americans live?**

Arab Americans live in all 50 states, but about a third are concentrated in California, Michigan and New York.
Another third are in these seven states: Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas and Virginia.

As of 2025, Michigan has the highest Arab American population at over 211,000 (about 2.1%), followed by New Jersey, California, New York, and Texas.
Nearly 75% reside in twelve states, including Florida, Illinois, and Ohio, and about 95% live in urban metropolitan areas.
Communities have grown notably in Minnesota and Virginia due to recent immigration.


**4. What are the population centers for Arab Americans?**

About half of Arab Americans live in 20 metropolitan areas.
The top historic centers are Los Angeles County in California; Wayne and Oakland counties in Michigan; Brooklyn, N.Y.; and Cook County, Ill.

As of 2025, major hubs include Detroit (with the largest concentration), New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Minneapolis.
Dearborn, Michigan, remains a key cultural center with significant Lebanese and Yemeni communities, and Southern California clusters continue to grow across Los Angeles and Orange County.


**5. Do Arabs have a shared language?**

The Arabic language is one of the great unifying and distinguishing characteristics of Arab people.
Even so, colloquial Arabic differs from place to place.
There are several categories: Levantine (Jordan, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon), Egyptian and North African dialects, and Khaliji (Gulf) dialects.
Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is a pan-Arabic language used in formal letters, books and newspapers, and Qur'anic Arabic differs in style and lexicon from MSA.
Not all Arab Americans know Arabic, as many are second-, third-, and fourth-generation Americans.

As of 2025, Arabic remains a core cultural element, but proficiency among U.S.-born Arab Americans has declined, prompting growth in Arabic immersion schools and online programs.
Arabic is among the most commonly spoken languages in U.S. households after Spanish in several metropolitan areas.


**6. Do Arabs have a shared religion?**

No.
Arabs belong to many religions, including Islam, Christianity, Druze, Judaism and others.
There are further distinctions within each of these, and some religious groups have evolved new identities and faith practices in the United States.
Be careful to distinguish religion from culture.
Although Arabs are connected by culture, they have different faiths.
Common misperceptions are to think that Arab traditions are Islamic, or that Islam unifies all Arabs.
Most Arab Americans are Catholic or Orthodox Christians, but this is not true in all parts of the United States, and in some areas most Arab Americans are Muslim.

As of 2025, best estimates put Arab Americans at roughly 63% Christian and 24% Muslim, with the remainder other faiths or unaffiliated, and recent immigration has increased Muslim representation in some communities.


**7. What is the Middle East conflict all about?**

This handbook cannot adequately answer that question.
The largest conflict in the Middle East is the Arab-Israeli conflict and the struggle over Palestine.
There are also disagreements between and within Arab countries.
The roots of these conflicts include religious history, ethnic differences, and borders drawn during 20th-century colonialism.
For more detailed answers, consult current, in-depth resources.

As of 2025, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains central, with the 2023–2024 Gaza war intensifying tensions and activism.
Other drivers include regional rivalries and civil conflicts in Syria and Yemen.


**8. How does conflict in the Middle East affect Arab Americans?**

Because Arabs maintain close family ties, even when separated, and because many Arab-American communities include recent immigrants, most people have a keen interest in news from the Middle East.
One reason many families immigrated was to escape conflicts that continue today.
Mideast issues can influence voting.
News coverage should be balanced, accurate, detailed and fair, and journalists must work to understand the issues.

As of 2025, events such as the Gaza crisis have mobilized communities and influenced elections, while advocacy groups document increased bias and call for balanced media coverage.


## Origins

**9. To which places do Arab Americans trace their ancestry?**

Arab Americans trace their roots to many places, including parts or all of Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen.
Some Arabs are Israeli citizens.

As of 2025, the most common ancestries include Lebanon, Syria, Egypt, Palestine, and Iraq, with recent waves from Yemen and Sudan due to conflict, and some Arab Israelis identifying within the community.


**10. Is Palestine a country?**

Historically, Palestine refers to a region east of the Mediterranean Sea that includes Israel and parts of present-day Jordan.
As a distinct region, Palestine was under Ottoman control and then British control until 1948, when the nation of Israel was created and areas of Palestine became Israel and part of Jordan.
Palestinians share a collective national identity with ongoing efforts toward self-governance.

As of 2025, Palestine is recognized by 145 UN member states, the Palestinian Authority governs parts of the West Bank, and Gaza is controlled by Hamas amid continuing conflict, with U.S. policy varying by administration.


**11. Shouldn't Iran be in that list?**

No.
Iran is not an Arab country.
Although Iran borders Iraq, it descends from the Persian empire and has a different language and cultural history than Arab countries.
The dominant language is Persian (Farsi), not Arabic, though other languages are spoken as well.

As of 2025, this distinction holds, though Iranian Americans are often included in broader MENA discussions, and media sometimes conflate identities in regional coverage.


**12. So, not all people from the Middle East are Arabs?**

That is correct.
The four main language groups in the Middle East are Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Turkish, with other significant groups including Kurdish and Berber.
Arabs are the largest by population and land area.

As of 2025, non-Arab groups such as Turks, Persians (Iranians), Kurds, Berbers, and Hebrew-speaking Israelis remain distinct, with active U.S. communities advocating for recognition (for example, Kurdish groups).


**13. Are there other groups from the Arab region?**

Yes.
Assyrians, Berbers (Amazigh), Chaldeans and Kurds have languages rooted in pre-Arabic times and often distinct religious traditions.
The Chaldeans are among the largest of these groups in the United States.

As of 2025, Chaldeans in metropolitan Detroit number around 150,000 and emphasize preservation of Aramaic language and culture, while Amazigh activism has elevated indigenous rights in North Africa and the diaspora.


**14. Who are Chaldeans?**

Chaldeans are Catholics from Iraq and a religious and ethnic minority there.
Large U.S. communities exist, especially in metropolitan Detroit, with parishes in Michigan, California, Illinois and Arizona.
Chaldeans and Assyrians, along with Arabs, are Semitic peoples with overlapping cultural foundations but different religious affiliations.

As of 2025, the community has grown due to instability in Iraq, maintains strong ties to the Catholic Church, and advocates for recognition separate from Arabs in policy and census contexts.


**15. So, are Chaldeans Arabs, or not?**

Chaldeans and Arabs share some issues, but they have different identities.
The Chaldean language is different from Arabic and, in Iraq, Chaldeans are religiously distinct from the Muslim majority.
While Chaldeans foster a separate identity, they also have an Iraqi nationality and some shared concerns with Arabs.
These nuances are often lost by federal classifications.
It is best to ask people how they would like to be identified, to be specific and, when relevant, to explain.

As of 2025, many prefer “Chaldean American,” and advocacy continues for clearer distinctions within any future MENA category.


## Language

**16. Is Arabic the only language spoken within the Arab world?**

No.
Assyrian and Chaldean services use dialects of Aramaic, and Berber and Kurdish are other non-Arabic languages in the region.

As of 2025, Tamazight (Berber) is recognized and taught in parts of Morocco and Algeria, and Kurdish is widely used in Iraq and Syria, with French and English common as second languages.


**17. So, do all Arab Americans speak one of these languages?**

No.
Many Arab-American families have been in the United States for generations.
Do not assume that an Arab American should know Arabic any more than any other American should speak the language of their heritage.

As of 2025, about 40% of Arab Americans speak Arabic at home, with retention dropping in later generations, and community programs promote bilingualism.


**18. Many recently immigrated Arab Americans also know French. Why is that?**

Part of the recent history of Arab people is colonization by the French and British.
In colonized countries, people in business and government learned European languages.

As of 2025, French remains influential in Lebanon, Morocco and Algeria, while English has gained prominence through globalization and media.


**19. Do Arab schools teach other languages?**

Definitely.
It is more common for Arab Americans to speak more than one language than it is for non-Arab Americans.
Many immigrants arrive knowing two or three languages, and Arab countries emphasize foreign language learning and familiarity with Western media.

As of 2025, U.S. schools in Arab-heavy areas offer Arabic classes and apps support language learning, and many immigrants arrive trilingual.


**20. Is there any advice on pronouncing Arabic names?**

Not really.
It can be difficult to transliterate Arabic words into English, a language with different phonemes and fewer letters.
If unsure, respectfully ask for pronunciation and preferred spelling and note both.
Be aware that spellings vary.

As of 2025, tools like Forvo and translation apps can help with audio, and common variations (for example, Muhammad/Mohammed) reflect dialect and transliteration choices.


**21. Is there any trick to spelling Arabic words?**

There are many variations, so it is crucial to ask for preferred spellings.
Because Arabic and English characters and sounds differ, there is more than one way to transliterate words.

As of 2025, AP style prefers “Quran” and “Muhammad,” but journalists should prioritize individuals’ preferred spellings when relevant.


**22. How is Arabic written?**

Arabic is one of several languages written from right to left.
It is not “backwards,” simply different.

As of 2025, right-to-left script has strong support in modern software, and calligraphy remains a highly regarded art form.


**23. Are characters in Arabic different than those used to write English?**

Yes.
English uses Latin characters, while Arabic uses a 28-letter alphabet whose letter forms change by position and connect like script.
Fine writing is called calligraphy and is highly regarded.

As of 2025, digital fonts and shaping engines handle cursive connections seamlessly across platforms.


## Demographics

**24. When did Arab people come to the United States?**

Today, most Arab Americans are native-born Americans.
The first significant wave of immigration began around 1875 and lasted until about 1920.
After a period of restriction, a second wave began in the 1940s.

As of 2025, a third wave followed the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act, and post-2010 arrivals included refugees from Syria, Iraq, and Yemen.
Over 85% are U.S. citizens and about 60% were born in the United States.


**25. Why did Arabs first come to the United States?**

Like many groups, early immigrants sought opportunity, including after Japanese competition hurt the Lebanese silk market and disease affected vineyards.
Most early immigrants were from Lebanon and Syria and most were Christian.

As of 2025, motivations include education, family reunification, and seeking safety from conflicts such as the Syrian civil war.


**26. What prompted the second wave?**

After 1940, immigration grew less economically driven and more influenced by conflict.
People came from many more places, and a higher share were Muslim compared to earlier waves.
Many in this wave were students and arrived with more resources.

As of 2025, post-1965 reforms, diversity visas, and refugee programs diversified origins, with notable numbers from Lebanon, Egypt and Syria.


**27. What race are Arab Americans?**

Arabs may have white skin and blue eyes, olive or dark skin and brown eyes, and various hair textures.
The United States has classified Arab immigrants in different ways over time.
Most Arab Americans identify more closely with nationality than with a pan-ethnic label.

As of 2025, the Census classifies MENA-origin people as White, and many advocate for a MENA category to better reflect identity and discrimination experiences.


**28. Are Arabs a minority group?**

This depends on your definition of minority.
The U.S. government does not classify Arabs as a minority group for purposes of employment and housing.
Arabs are not defined specifically by race, but are united by elements of culture and language.
Some see minority classification as an impediment to full participation, while others seek protections against profiling and exclusion.

As of 2025, advocacy for minority recognition within a MENA category has grown amid rising Islamophobia and other forms of bias.


**29. Are Arab Americans more closely tied to their country of origin, or to America?**

This need not be an either-or issue.
Arab Americans often maintain close ties to countries of origin while also being fully American.
Most were born in the United States and are U.S. citizens.

As of 2025, dual identity and transnational engagement are common, with many supporting causes abroad while participating actively in U.S. civic life.


**30. Who are some well-known Arab Americans?**

Examples include Christa McAuliffe, Bobby Rahal, Doug Flutie, Casey Kasem and Don Bustany, Candy Lightner, Jacques Nasser, and Helen Thomas.

As of 2025, contemporary figures include politicians Rashida Tlaib, Justin Amash, and Darrell Issa; actor Rami Malek; model Gigi Hadid; actress Salma Hayek; and activist Linda Sarsour.


**31. Does the U.S. Census Bureau collect data on Arab Americans?**

While the census does not specifically classify Arab Americans, it collects enough data to present some population characteristics.
Some of that information is on the U.S. Census Bureau's website and is reflected here.

As of 2025, the 2020 Census allowed write-ins for ancestry and released MENA data in 2023, and proposals for a 2030 MENA checkbox are under consideration.


**32. What is the educational level of Arab Americans?**

Arab Americans are, on average, more likely to have attended college than the national average, with higher rates of advanced degrees.
Key factors include country of origin, time in the United States and gender.

As of 2025, about half hold a bachelor's degree or higher (versus roughly one-third nationally), with strong representation in STEM and business and narrowing gender gaps.


**33. What occupations do Arab Americans pursue?**

Arab Americans work in all occupations and are more likely than average to be self-employed or entrepreneurs, or to work in sales.
Roughly 60% are in executive, professional, office and sales roles, varying by location and demographics.

As of 2025, entrepreneurship remains high (about 12% self-employed vs. 9% nationally), with strong growth in technology and healthcare.


**34. How do Arab Americans fare economically?**

Individually, Arab Americans are at every economic stratum of American life.
Nationally, Arab-American households have a higher-than-average median income, with variation by location.

As of 2025, median household income is around $70,000 (slightly above national), but poverty rates are higher in some immigrant communities, and overall MENA spending power is substantial.


## Family

**35. What is the role of the family in Arab culture?**

The variety of family types among Arab Americans is vast and influenced by the same factors mentioned in the answer to Question 33.
Generally, family is more important than the individual and more influential than nationality.
People draw much of their identity from their role in the family.
Historically, extended families and clans helped one another immigrate.

As of 2025, multigenerational households remain common among immigrants, while assimilation has increased nuclear family structures and cross-border remittances remain strong.


**36. Do Arab Americans maintain ties with their home countries?**

Many do.
People may maintain regular contact with relatives or friends there and take pride in home countries while being fully American.

As of 2025, digital tools like WhatsApp and social media facilitate transnational ties, remittances exceed billions annually, and cultural festivals reinforce community pride.


**37. What are gender roles like for Arab Americans?**

These vary tremendously.
Variables include country of origin, rural versus urban backgrounds, time in the United States, religion, class, and personal preference.
It is more accurate to ask people about their own experiences than to generalize.

As of 2025, Arab American women lead in education and careers in many communities and are visible in public office and advocacy.


**38. Do Arab Americans have large families?**

Arab-American families are, on average, larger than non-Arab-American families and smaller than families in many Arab countries.
Historically, more children meant pride and economic contribution, but U.S. costs and norms encourage smaller families.

As of 2025, average family size trends toward the U.S. norm and changes with assimilation.


**39. What kind of relationship does cousin mean to Arab Americans?**

The same as for other Americans, though people may differentiate between maternal and paternal cousins.

As of 2025, extended family networks remain important in many communities, and cousin marriage is rare in the U.S.


**40. Do generations of Arab Americans live together?**

Sometimes, especially among more recent immigrants, though this is not unique to Arab Americans.

As of 2025, roughly one-fifth of households in some communities are multigenerational, driven by culture and economics.


**41. Do Arab Americans typically get married at a younger age than non-Arabs?**

Historically yes, though norms vary widely and have shifted.
As women pursue education and careers, expectations about age at marriage have changed.

As of 2025, average marriage ages align closely with U.S. norms in many communities.


**42. Are marriages arranged?**

This is rare, except among some recent immigrants.
Most Arab Americans were born in the United States and frequently marry outside their heritage.
Where arrangements occur, they typically involve introductions rather than compulsion, and couples commonly make their own decisions.

As of 2025, culturally-aware dating apps serve some communities, but patterns broadly mirror U.S. trends.


**43. Do Arab Americans prefer to marry each other?**

As with many groups, in-group marriage may be encouraged to preserve heritage, but people frequently marry across groups.
Religious differences may shape preferences more than ethnicity.

As of 2025, intermarriage is common, with higher rates among Christians than Muslims.


**44. Are there any Arab conventions for naming children?**

Muslims often name children after prophets in the Quran, and Shi’a Muslims sometimes use Ali as a middle name.
Christians often choose names from the Bible.
Names can signal religion, but do not assume.
Traditions may call for the father’s name as a middle name.

As of 2025, blended naming patterns are common, including American first names with Arabic middle names.


**45. What does the title Umm or Abu mean as part of a name?**

It is a common way of addressing someone using their oldest child’s name.
Umm means “mother of,” and Abu means “father of.”
For example, “Umm Muhammad” means “mother of Muhammad,” used as a sign of respect among friends and family.

As of 2025, usage is mostly informal, and professional settings favor full names.


**46. What do Arabs mean when they refer to someone as Auntie?**

It is a sign of respect, not necessarily a family relationship.
Someone might call an older neighbor “auntie” or “uncle.”
Many do not use these terms at all.
Journalists can show respect by using appropriate courtesy titles.

As of 2025, usage remains common in close-knit communities and reflects collectivist values.


## Customs

**47. Why do some Arab women wear garments that cover their faces or heads?**

This is primarily a religious practice rooted in Islamic teachings about modesty.
Covering is not universal among Muslim women and varies by region, class and personal preference, and family members may differ in practice.

As of 2025, surveys suggest a majority of observant Muslim women in the U.S. choose some form of head covering, often framing it as empowerment and identity.


**48. What garments might a woman wear to practice hijab?**

One interpretation covers everything except hands, face and feet.
Long clothing with a headscarf may be called a hijab, while long robes include abaya or jilbab.
Beneath a robe, a woman may wear anything from traditional dress to business attire.
Veiling has been politicized by governments and public debates.

As of 2025, modest fashion has flourished, with many brands serving Muslim consumers.


**49. Some Arab men wear a checked garment on their heads. What is that?**

It is called a keffiyeh (kafiyyeh) and is traditional, not religious.
Wearing it signals identity and cultural pride.

As of 2025, it is widely recognized as a symbol of Palestinian solidarity in public demonstrations.


**50. Why do some Arab women dress in black?**

Black is popular in fashion and may have no special significance.
When it does, it can signify mourning, with duration varying by tradition and personal choice.

As of 2025, urban fashion trends and cultural practices both influence clothing choices.


**51. What is an appropriate way to greet an Arab American?**

This is not difficult or tricky.
Most Arab Americans grew up in the United States and do not require special greetings.
Be yourself and follow cues.
A smile, a nod and a word of greeting are appropriate in most situations, and some people prefer not to shake hands across genders.
Wait for the other person to extend a hand before you extend your own.

As of 2025, greetings like “Salaam alaikum” are common among Muslims, while handshakes and casual greetings are widely used.


**52. What are the customs for paying compliments?**

Be yourself and be observant.
In most cases, there is no need to behave differently than you would with anyone else.
Among some recent immigrants, a bit more reserve may be appreciated.
Complimenting a possession may be interpreted as interest, prompting an offer out of hospitality.
Do not assume one approach works for everyone.

As of 2025, reciprocity in hospitality remains a valued norm.


**53. What about gift-giving?**

Token gifts are a polite practice in many cultures and settings.
Journalists should balance ethics policies against the risk of offending someone by refusing a gift.
Consider policy, intention, potential effects and value, and seek guidance as needed.

As of 2025, disclosure and training around cultural sensitivity help navigate these situations.


**54. What is Middle-Eastern food like?**

Tasty and varied.
Common staples include wheat (for bread, pastries, salads and mains), rice with vegetables and meats, and legumes and vegetables such as eggplant, zucchini, cauliflower, spinach, onions, parsley and chickpeas.

As of 2025, fusion cuisines and widespread halal options are common across U.S. cities.


**55. What is that pipe I sometimes see people smoking?**

It is a water pipe that filters and cools tobacco smoke, often flavored with fruit or mint.
These pipes are used in several parts of the world and are not exclusively Arab.
Names include shisha, hookah and argileh.

As of 2025, hookah lounges are common in many cities and subject to local flavored tobacco regulations.


## Religion

**56. Do most Arab Americans belong to the same religion?**

Most Arab Americans are Christian, though this varies by region.
In many communities, Muslim and Christian Arabs live side by side with each other and with non-Arab religious communities.
Most Arab countries are predominantly Muslim.

As of 2025, estimates suggest U.S. Arab Americans are about 63% Christian and 24% Muslim.


**57. Is Islam mostly an Arab religion, then?**

No.
Only a minority of Muslims worldwide are Arabs.
There are more Muslims in Indonesia alone than in any single Arab country, and large populations live in India, Iran, other parts of East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
Islam has an Arab linguistic and geographic heritage, with its holiest places in the Middle East and a scripture originally in Arabic.

As of 2025, global Muslims number roughly 1.9 billion, with Arabs a minority of that total, and about 4–5 million Muslims live in the United States.


**58. What is the Quran (or Koran)?**

The Quran is the holy book for Muslims, believed to contain the word of God revealed to the prophet Muhammad.
It has many passages similar to those in the Bible, which Muslims also regard as a holy book.
The Quran has been translated into many languages and is widely available.
AP style uses “Quran,” though other transliterations exist.

As of 2025, digital apps offer recitations and study tools, and discussions on interpretation remain active across traditions.


**59. What is the difference between Islam and Muslim?**

Islam is the religion, and a Muslim is a follower of the religion.
The adjective form is “Islamic.”

As of 2025, use precise terms and avoid conflating religious identity with political movements.


**60. What are the five pillars of Islam?**

The five pillars are core obligations for followers who are able to observe them: belief in the shahada (“There is no god but God, and Muhammad is His messenger”); salat (prayer five times a day); zakat (almsgiving); fasting during Ramadan; and the hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca).

As of 2025, apps assist with prayer times and charity organizations facilitate zakat.


**61. What is Ramadan?**

Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, is a month of fasting and spiritual focus ending with the celebration of Eid al-Fitr.
From before sunrise until sundown, Muslims abstain from food, drink and sex, and may gather for meals at night.
Because the calendar is lunar, Ramadan shifts earlier each year on the civil calendar.

As of 2025, more workplaces and schools offer accommodations and community iftars are common.


**62. What is the proper greeting during Ramadan?**

You may say “Ramadan Mubarak” or “Ramadan Kareem.”
“Salaam” (“peace”) is welcome at any time.
Be aware of fasting schedules when planning meetings.

As of 2025, many institutions include Ramadan in cultural calendars and offer flexibility.


**63. Must Arabs make a journey to Mecca?**

This relates to Muslims, not all Arabs.
Muslims who are financially and physically able are expected to make the journey at least once in their lifetime.

As of 2025, annual attendance has rebounded post-pandemic and U.S. pilgrims typically participate through organized programs.


**64. What does hajj mean?**

Al-hajj refers to the pilgrimage to Mecca by millions of Muslims once each year and is a milestone in a Muslim’s life.
A man who makes the trip may be called hajji (pilgrim); for women, hajjah.

As of 2025, titles are used respectfully, and virtual tours provide education for non-pilgrims.


**65. What is the difference between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims?**

Historically, these are the two main branches of Islam, differing initially over succession after the prophet Muhammad.
There are many theological, legal and cultural distinctions within and between both branches, and unity often overshadows divisions in U.S. communities.
Most Muslims worldwide and in the United States are Sunni, with Shi’a majorities in some countries and communities.

As of 2025, U.S. Muslims are predominantly Sunni, with a significant Shi’a minority and many unaffiliated with specific schools.


**66. Are there restrictions on entering a mosque?**

One generally removes shoes upon entry.
Look for signs and ask a host.
Dress modestly; head coverings may be offered or requested.
Prayer spaces are typically separated for men and women.

As of 2025, many mosques offer tours and open houses.


**67. Is it OK to take pictures there?**

Each mosque has its own rules.
