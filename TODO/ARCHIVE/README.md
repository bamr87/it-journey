# 📦 TODO Archive

> **Purpose**: Historical reference for completed TODO projects

This directory contains archived TODO projects that have been completed. Each project is preserved for:
- Historical reference
- Learning from past approaches
- Reusing successful patterns
- Maintaining project history

## Archive Guidelines

### When to Archive
- All tasks in the project are marked complete
- Success metrics have been measured and documented
- Lessons learned have been captured
- No active work remains

### Archive Process
1. Verify all tasks are complete
2. Document final outcomes and metrics
3. Move project folder to `ARCHIVE/`
4. Update `STATUS.md` dashboard
5. Update main `README.md` to remove active references

### Archive Structure
```
ARCHIVE/

├── YYYY-MM-project-name/        # Archived project folder
