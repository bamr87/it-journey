## 🎯 Session Summary

I walked a **window of 5 quests (1–5 of 8)** from the **Game Developer** path at
**Level 0100 — Frontend & Containers** (Adventurer ⚔️), in plan order, as a learner
would: two Docker main quests, then two Jekyll+Bootstrap main quests, then one Jekyll
refactoring side quest. Evidence came from the workflow-sealed execute engine
(`walk-evidence.json`), which I consumed as-is.

**Headline verdict: FAIL for the slice as a learning path.** Of the five, only three
produced machine verdicts (avg **51.7%**): one warn (`jekyll-component-refactoring`,
70), two fail (`frontend`, 55; `frontend-docker`, 30). The **two lead quests that
define the whole level — `container-fundamentals` and `docker-compose-orchestration`
— errored in the sandbox (engine hit `max_turns` retrying unreachable `curl` calls)
and have no content verdict at all**, so the chain's foundation is un-witnessed by the
engine. On top of that, the two `draft: true` frontend quests (`frontend-docker`,
`frontend`) are demonstrably broken when followed verbatim (gem-persistence crash,
`cd` into a directory never created, editing theme files that don't exist locally,
Bootstrap that never actually renders). A maintainer's highest-leverage fixes are: (1)
resolve the Docker-quest evidence gap, and (2) repair or de-list the two draft frontend
quests before a beginner is routed through them.

## 🗺️ The Journey

| # | Verdict | Quest | Score | One-line takeaway |
|---|:--:|---|:--:|---|
| 1 | ⚠️ errored | Docker Container Fundamentals: Images to Registries | — | Engine hit `max_turns` retrying `curl localhost:8080` (nginx unreachable in sandbox); **no content verdict** — reasoned-only, looks structurally strong. |
| 2 | ⚠️ errored | Docker Compose Orchestration: Multi-Container Apps | — | Same failure mode (`max_turns` on repeated `curl localhost:8080`); **no content verdict** — reasoned-only, well-structured and prereq-linked. |
| 3 | ❌ fail | Dockering Jekyll with Bootstrap 5 | 30 | Core payoff never works as written: `docker-compose up` gem crash, phantom `cd my-jekyll-site`, `{% raw %}` wrapper + missing front matter means Bootstrap never renders; BS4 markup labelled "BS5". |
| 4 | ❌ fail | Frontend Forests: Building a Jekyll Site with Bootstrap | 55 | Ch.9 theory is accurate & verified, but Steps 3–4 tell learners to edit `_includes/head.html` / `_layouts/default.html` that don't exist in a fresh `jekyll new` site; undocumented gem-permission failures; CDN snippet never shown. |
| 5 | ⚠️ warn | The Artisan's Forge: Refactoring Jekyll Theme Components | 70 | Technically sound and builds end-to-end; only Step 2.1's `touch` fails (missing `mkdir -p`), plus an aria-label drop, a duplicate Resources block, and two untaught bonus objectives. |

## 🔬 Evidence

All numbers below are quoted from the sealed `walk-evidence.json` (execute mode,
`mock: false`). Per-dimension scores are 1–5.

### 1. Docker Container Fundamentals — ⚠️ errored (no verdict)
- **Engine result:** `verdict: fail`, `overall: 0.0`, `error: "claude exited 1 … Reached maximum number of turns (40)"`. `meta: {}` (no dimensions, no snippet tallies).
- The error trace shows the agent looping on real commands it *did* run —
  `docker run --name web -d -p 8080:80 nginx:alpine`, then repeated
  `curl -s http://localhost:8080` and `curl http://localhost:3000` — never getting a
  response, exhausting the 40-turn budget. This is a **sandbox/engine limitation**
  (published container port not reachable via `curl` in the runner), **not** evidence
  of a content defect. **No pass/fail on any quest step can be claimed here.**

### 2. Docker Compose Orchestration — ⚠️ errored (no verdict)
- **Engine result:** `verdict: fail`, `overall: 0.0`, `error: "claude exited 1 … Reached maximum number of turns (40)"`; `meta: {}`.
- Error trace shows `permission_denials` on `curl -s http://localhost:8080/` (looped
  `for i in 1 2 3; do curl …`) plus `curl -s -m 5 http://127.0.0.1:8080/`. Same
  unreachable-port loop as quest 1. `costUSD` ≈ 0.98 was spent before the turn cap.
  **No content verdict; reasoned-only.**

### 3. Dockering Jekyll with Bootstrap 5 — ❌ fail (30)
- **Dimensions:** commands_work 1 · content_accuracy 1 · completeness 1 · clarity 2 · structure 2 · safety 4. `weight_covered: 1.0`.
- **Snippets:** available 8 (4 runnable) · recorded 9 · **ran 6 · passed 1 · failed 5 · skipped 1 · reasoned 2** · executed.
- Real commands the engine ran in the sandbox:
  - `docker compose run jekyll jekyll new .` → **failed**: `docker-compose` binary absent (exit 127); substituted `docker compose`, then `Conflict: /srv/jekyll exists and is not empty.` (exit 1) — Dockerfile/compose already in the dir.
  - `cd my-jekyll-site` → **failed**: `jekyll new .` installed in place; that subdirectory is never created.
  - `index.md` Bootstrap sample with `{% raw %}{% include head.html %}{% endraw %}` → **failed**: built in real Jekyll — with no front matter Jekyll copies the file verbatim, output contained literal `{% include head.html %}`, **Bootstrap never included**.
  - `docker compose up -d` → **failed**: container crash-loops with `Bundler::GemNotFound: Could not find base64-0.3.0, csv-3.3.5, json-2.20.0, logger-1.7.0, bigdecimal…` (no `bundle install`).
  - `git init / add / commit` → **passed** (root commit, 11 files). Registry `git push` → **skipped** (placeholder remote, unsafe).
  - `_includes/head.html` block & `Dockerfile` → **reasoned**: valid syntax but BS4 attrs (`data-toggle`), needless jQuery, `integrity="sha384-xxx"` placeholder; Dockerfile is dead weight (no `build:` in compose).

### 4. Frontend Forests — ❌ fail (55)
- **Dimensions:** commands_work 2 · content_accuracy 3 · completeness 2 · clarity 3 · structure 3 · safety 5. `weight_covered: 1.0`.
- **Snippets:** available 8 (0 runnable) · recorded 17 · **ran 9 · passed 5 · failed 4 · skipped 0 · reasoned 8** · executed.
- Real commands:
  - `gem install jekyll bundler` → **failed** as written (targets `/var/lib/gems/3.2.0`, not writable); only succeeded with `--user-install`.
  - `jekyll new your-site-name` → **failed**: auto `bundle install` hit `Bundler::PermissionError` on `/var/lib/gems/3.2.0/cache/*.gem`.
  - `cd your-site-name` → **passed**; `bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle' && bundle install` (not in quest, needed to unblock) → **passed** (38 gems).
  - **Step 3** edit `_includes/head.html` → **failed**: file does not exist in a fresh site (`find . -not -path './vendor*'` confirms); lives only in `vendor/bundle/…/minima-2.5.2/_includes/head.html`.
  - **Step 4** edit `_layouts/default.html` → **failed**: same — only inside the minima gem.
  - `bundle exec jekyll build` → **passed** (valid `_site/`, only unrelated minima Sass deprecations); `bundle exec jekyll serve` → **passed**.
  - Filter table (`date`/`slugify`/`where`) → **passed**, verified live: `{{ "My Title" | slugify }}` → `my-title`. Ch.9 Liquid/layout material → **reasoned** accurate.

### 5. The Artisan's Forge — ⚠️ warn (70)
- **Dimensions:** commands_work 3 · content_accuracy 4 · completeness 3 · clarity 3 · structure 4 · safety 5. `weight_covered: 1.0`.
- **Snippets:** available 13 (3 runnable) · recorded 13 · **ran 10 · passed 9 · failed 1 · skipped 1 · reasoned 2** · executed.
- Real commands:
  - **Step 2.1** `touch _includes/components/nanobar.html` → **failed**: `cannot touch … No such file or directory` — `components/` never created (Step 3.1 correctly does `mkdir -p _sass/components`).
  - After adding the dir: `{% include components/nanobar.html %}` → **passed**; `nanobar:` config in `_config.yml` → **passed** (rendered `position=top`, `color=#0d6efd`, `height=3px`, `z_index=1050`).
  - Step 3.1 `mkdir -p _sass/components && touch …` → **passed**; SCSS `@import` + build → **passed** (compiled `.nanobar` rules present in `_site/…/main.css`).
  - Step 3.3 nanobar markup → **passed** (`style="--nanobar-height: 3px; --nanobar-color: #0d6efd; …"`) — **but drops the `aria-label`** that Step 2.2 had.
  - Phase 4 scroll `<script>`, Phase 5 footer AFTER snippet, Phase 7 `bundle exec jekyll build`, and `nanobar.enabled: false` toggle → all **passed** (build exit 0; toggle → 0 nanobar occurrences).
  - Phase 7 `docker-compose exec … --config '_config_dev.yml'` alt → **skipped**: needs a project-specific compose service + `_config_dev.yml` never introduced.

## 🐞 Issues Found

Every item below is backed by a real sandbox command (quests 3–5) or a directly quoted
quest line (quests 1–2, reasoned-only). Issues on the two errored quests are labelled
`reasoned` because the engine produced no content verdict for them.

### High
- **H1 · frontend-docker · Step 2/Step 5 (`docker-compose up`)** — *observed:* container crash-loops with `Bundler::GemNotFound` because no gems are installed in the fresh image. *Fix:* bake `bundle install` into the build (a `build: .` Dockerfile with `RUN bundle install`) or add it to the compose `command`.
- **H2 · frontend-docker · Step 2→3 (`jekyll new .` / `cd my-jekyll-site`)** — *observed:* `jekyll new .` installs in place; `cd my-jekyll-site` then fails (no such dir), and `jekyll new .` itself hits `Conflict: /srv/jekyll exists and is not empty`. *Fix:* drop the `cd`, and document `jekyll new . --force` since Dockerfile/compose already occupy the dir.
- **H3 · frontend-docker · Step 4 (Bootstrap include)** — *observed:* built in real Jekyll, the `{% raw %}{% include head.html %}{% endraw %}` file with no front matter is copied verbatim; Bootstrap is never included. *Fix:* add `---\n---` front matter and remove the `{% raw %}` wrapper (or explain it is a doc-escaping artifact, not to be copied).
- **H4 · frontend-docker · Step 4 (BS version accuracy)** — *observed:* "Bootstrap 5" sample uses BS4 `data-toggle`/`data-target`, `.jumbotron`, `.sr-only`, and jQuery. *Fix:* use `data-bs-toggle`/`data-bs-target`, BS5 utilities instead of `.jumbotron`, `.visually-hidden` instead of `.sr-only`, drop jQuery.
- **H5 · frontend · Steps 3 & 4 (edit theme files)** — *observed:* `_includes/head.html` and `_layouts/default.html` do not exist in a fresh `jekyll new` site (`find` confirms; they live in the minima gem). This contradicts the quest's own Chapter 9 override explanation. *Fix:* instruct learners to copy the files out of the theme gem (or create them at those paths) first, and cross-reference Ch.9.
- **H6 · frontend · Steps 1–2 (gem/bundle install)** — *observed:* `gem install` and `jekyll new`'s auto-`bundle install` fail with `PermissionError` on the system gemdir. *Fix:* document `--user-install` or `bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'` as the supported path.
- **H7 · frontend · Steps 3–4 (Bootstrap CDN snippet)** — *observed:* quest describes *where* to add Bootstrap but never shows the actual `<link>`/`<script>` tags. *Fix:* include the pinned CDN snippet learners can paste.

### Medium
- **M1 · jekyll-component-refactoring · Step 2.1** — *observed:* `touch _includes/components/nanobar.html` fails (`No such file or directory`); Step 3.1 does the analogous `mkdir -p` correctly. *Fix:* change to `mkdir -p _includes/components && touch _includes/components/nanobar.html`.
- **M2 · jekyll-component-refactoring · Step 2.2 vs 3.3 (aria-label)** — *observed:* the built Step 3.3 markup silently drops `aria-label="Reading progress"` present in 2.2, shipping a progressbar with no accessible name. *Fix:* keep the aria-label in 3.3 or state the change explicitly.
- **M3 · frontend-docker · docker-compose/Dockerfile relationship** — *reasoned:* the authored Dockerfile is never used (compose pulls the image directly, no `build:`). *Fix:* add `build: .` or drop the Dockerfile step.
- **M4 · frontend & frontend-docker · auto-seeded objectives** — *observed in source:* both quests carry the placeholder "Understand the core concepts introduced in this quest…" block with the `objectives auto-seeded during framework alignment` note still visible to learners. *Fix:* replace with concrete, checkable outcomes.

### Low
- **L1 · frontend-docker · CDN & SRI** — `integrity="sha384-xxx"` placeholders + outdated `stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com`. *Fix:* link jsDelivr with real current hashes.
- **L2 · frontend-docker · tooling drift** — obsolete `version: '3'` key and hyphenated `docker-compose` throughout; the sandbox's `docker-compose` binary was absent (exit 127). *Fix:* remove `version:` and use `docker compose` (v2).
- **L3 · jekyll-component-refactoring · duplicate Resources block & untaught bonus objectives** — *observed:* a second identical `## 📚 Resources` block after the closing line; "step animation" and "CI validation test" objectives are named but never taught. *Fix:* dedupe; add samples or drop the objectives.
- **L4 · frontend · Knowledge-Graph `[[wiki-link]]`** — resolves only inside the IT-Journey/Obsidian vault; renders as broken text elsewhere. *Note for learners.*
- **L5 · frontend-docker metadata** — `draft: true`, empty prerequisites/rewards, Node.js listed as a tool but never used. Same `draft: true` on `frontend`. *Fix:* finish or clearly gate these drafts.

**No blocking issue was found in quests 1 or 2** — but that is *not* a clean bill of
health: those two were never scored (see §7). It means "unverified," not "passed."

## 🔗 Chain Continuity

Read as one Game-Developer → 0100 journey, the slice **does not currently hold together
as an authored path**, even though its intended arc is sound:

- **Two disjoint sub-arcs.** Quests 1–2 (`container-fundamentals` → `docker-compose-orchestration`) form a clean, well-linked Docker arc: quest 2 declares `required_quests: [container-fundamentals]`, its prose explicitly builds on "single containers you already forged," and it re-teaches the `docker compose up` on-ramp that quest 1 previews in its Chapter 4. Prereqs are satisfied *within the pair*. Quests 3–4 (`frontend-docker`, `frontend`) are a **separate, older `draft: true` Jekyll+Bootstrap sub-arc** with empty `quest_dependencies` and no link back to the Docker arc — a learner arriving from quest 2 gets no bridge into them.
- **A prerequisite the path never provides.** `frontend` Steps 1–2 assume a working host Ruby/Bundler toolchain and *local* theme files, while `frontend-docker` assumes Docker — yet neither the Docker arc nor these quests hand off the Jekyll environment cleanly. The engine had to invent `bundle config set --local path` to make `frontend` build at all; a real beginner following the text verbatim stalls at the very first `gem install`.
- **Ordering smell.** `frontend-docker` (score 30) and `frontend` (55) are the two weakest, most dated quests, yet they sit *ahead* of the polished side quest `jekyll-component-refactoring` (70) whose `recommended_quests` points *back* to `frontend-docker`. So the side quest sends learners back into the most broken quest in the slice for its assumed setup (a Docker Jekyll project + `_config_dev.yml`), which `frontend-docker` never actually leaves in a working state (H1–H3).
- **Where a real learner gets stuck:** (a) the Docker arc — likely fine, but unproven here; (b) `frontend-docker` Step 2, at the first `docker-compose` command (binary/ naming + gem crash); (c) `frontend` Step 1, at `gem install` permissions; (d) `frontend`/`frontend-docker` Steps 3–4, editing theme files that aren't there. The one quest that would leave a learner genuinely "ready for the next step" is quest 5 — ironically the side quest, not the main line.

**Continuity verdict:** the Docker pair is a coherent (if un-witnessed) mini-path; the
frontend pair is broken-as-written and only loosely bolted on. The slice needs the two
draft quests repaired or resequenced before it reads as one journey.

## 🧠 Reasoning & Method

- **Mode & evidence.** Execute mode, sealed by the workflow. I consumed
  `walk-plan.json` and `walk-evidence.json` / `walk-evidence.md` **as-is** — I did not
  re-run the engine (its child `claude` processes can't authenticate from my Bash tool)
  and did not edit any plan/evidence file. All pass/fail/skip/reasoned tallies and
  per-dimension scores in §4 are quoted from that sealed evidence; all quest-source
  quotes in §5 come from reading the five `path`s in plan order.
- **What I ran vs. reasoned.** I ran no quest commands myself (read-only session); the
  *engine* ran them in its disposable sandbox and I reported its witnessed results.
  For quests **3–5** that evidence is real and rich (per-dimension scores + executed
  snippet tallies). For quests **1–2** there is **no content verdict** — I reasoned
  about them statically from the source only, and I have labelled every statement about
  them `reasoned`.
- **Coverage limits (honest).**
  1. **2 of 5 quests errored** (`max_turns`) and are un-scored — the two most important
     quests in the level (the Docker foundation) among them. The engine's own `fail /
     0.0` for these reflects an execution abort, **not** a content judgment, and I have
     not reported it as one.
  2. The abort cause was a **sandbox networking limitation**: published container ports
     were not reachable via `curl localhost:8080`, so the agent looped until the turn
     cap. This is an engine/sandbox artifact and may recur; the Docker quests likely
     need a lighter verification step (or a longer turn budget / `--no-network` shim) to
     ever score.
  3. This is a **window (1 of 2)** of an 8-quest level; quests 6–8 were out of scope and
     the level cannot be certified from this run alone.
  4. Browser-dependent behavior (scroll animation, live Bootstrap rendering) was not
     exercised — no browser in the sandbox — and is marked `reasoned` where relevant.
- **Confidence.** *High* for the three scored quests (real, reproducible command
  failures with quoted output). *Low* for quests 1–2 — structurally they look strong and
  well-linked, but I witnessed nothing, so I make no quality claim about them.
- **Overall verdict = fail** for the slice: average 51.7% across scored quests, two
  hard-fail draft quests blocking a beginner, and the foundation pair unverified. Not a
  path I could hand a real Game-Developer learner today without the H-series fixes and a
  resolution of the Docker evidence gap.
