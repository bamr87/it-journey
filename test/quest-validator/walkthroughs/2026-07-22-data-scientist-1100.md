## 🎯 Session Summary

I walked a **5-quest window** (window 1 of 3; the full Level 1100 slice holds 15 quests) of the **Data Scientist** path at **Level 1100 — Data Engineering (Master ⚡)**, playing each quest as a learner in a disposable Linux sandbox. The machine evidence was pre-computed and sealed by the workflow's execute-engine step (`--mode execute`); I consumed `walk-evidence.json` as-is and reasoned about the linked journey on top of it.

**Headline verdict: ⚠️ warn.** The foundational data-engineering quest (**Data Warehousing**, 80) and the first automation quest (**The Editor's Eye**, 84) are strong and their runnable snippets executed correctly. But **two of the five quests fail the rubric** (**The Agent Pantheon** 48, **The Autonomy Scales** 59) and one warns (**The Bard Forge** 62), all for the same reason: blocks a learner would actually copy-paste-and-run are broken — leaked Jekyll `{% raw %}` templating, references to `scripts/validate_quest.py` and helper scripts that no step ever creates, and shell/workflow bugs. None of these are conceptual failures; the *teaching* is sound throughout. They are fixable follow-along defects, and the two `fail` quests share a root cause worth fixing once across the level.

An important framing note for the maintainer: this window is a **level cross-section, not a single learning line** — it interleaves three unrelated quest series (Data Engineering Mastery, The Self-Operating Website, agentic-ai gh-600) that happen to share the `1100` code. See §🔗 Chain Continuity.

## 🗺️ The Journey

| # | Verdict | Quest | Score | Snippets | One-line takeaway |
|---|:--:|---|--:|:--:|---|
| 1 | ✅ pass | Data Warehousing: Build a Dimensional Star Schema in SQL | 80 | 7/9 ran | Star schema, snowflake & Type-2 SCD SQL all executed in SQLite/DuckDB; only gap is no sample data before the payoff query + a Windows `sqlite3` install gap. |
| 2 | ✅ pass | The Editor's Eye: A Reviewer, and the Dragon It Becomes | 84 | 4/6 recorded (1✗) | Diff-collection, smuggle-guard and loop-breaker logic ran exactly as documented; one real YAML parse error lives in the intentionally-`BROKEN` boss example. |
| 3 | ⚠️ warn | The Bard Forge: The Quest That Writes Quests | 62 | 3/4 recorded (2✗) | Sound trust-boundary architecture, but `mine_merge.sh`'s error path is unreachable, and the proposal-PR step fails on missing git identity + an uncreated `proposed/` dir. |
| 4 | ❌ fail | The Agent Pantheon: Multi-Agent Lifecycle Management | 48 | 5/6 recorded (2✗) | Registry/docs artifacts are clean, but the health-monitor workflow leaks `{% raw %}` tags + calls non-existent scripts, and the quest's own `validate_quest.py` 404s. |
| 5 | ❌ fail | The Autonomy Scales: Mapping Agent Autonomy Levels | 59 | 4/5 recorded (2✗) | Autonomy matrix parses cleanly, but Chapter 3's workflow has a `{% raw %}`-leak `bad substitution` bug + a `\n` escaping mistake, and Chapter 4/Validation reference uncreated artifacts. |

Per-dimension engine scores (1–5): quest 1 commands 4 / accuracy 4 / completeness 3 / clarity 4 / structure 5 / safety 5 · quest 2 commands 4 / accuracy 4 / completeness 4 / clarity 5 / structure 5 / safety 4 · quest 3 commands 2 / accuracy 3 / completeness 3 / clarity 4 / structure 4 / safety 5 · quest 4 commands 2 / accuracy 2 / completeness 2 / clarity 3 / structure 3 / safety 4 · quest 5 commands 2 / accuracy 3 / completeness 3 / clarity 3 / structure 4 / safety 5. The pattern is consistent: `commands_work` is the collapsing dimension on the three flagged quests.

## 🔬 Evidence

All statuses below are from commands the sealed execute engine actually ran in the sandbox, or are labelled `reasoned` where it judged statically. Quotes are trimmed from `walk-evidence.json`.

### 1. Data Warehousing — 80 (pass) · ran 7/9 runnable, 2 reasoned, 0 failed
- **`passed`** — Linux setup: `python3 -m venv .venv && … pip install duckdb` ran; `python3`/`sqlite3` already present.
- **`passed`** — DuckDB smoke test: `python -c "import duckdb; …SELECT 42 AS answer"` → "printed the expected `answer=42` table" (duckdb 1.5.5).
- **`passed`** — Star-schema DDL: "All four tables created successfully in SQLite 3.45.1 with `sqlite3 warehouse.db < star_schema.sql`; `.tables` confirmed all four exist."
- **`passed`** (with caveat) — revenue-by-city-by-quarter query: "returned the expected 3 rows sorted by revenue descending **once I supplied sample INSERTs myself**; run verbatim right after the CREATE TABLE block with no data, it returns an empty result set (no error, but no payoff) — the quest never supplies sample data."
- **`passed`** — snowflake normalization (`dim_category` + `ALTER TABLE`) and Type-2 SCD close+insert sequence both executed; final SCD table correctly shows the closed Austin row + new current Denver row.
- **`passed`** — `columnar_demo.py` over `range(5_000_000)` "ran in ~0.37s … produced correct aggregate output over 5,000,000 rows."
- **`reasoned`** — macOS/Homebrew path (no macOS in sandbox) and Windows/winget path (no Windows). The engine flagged the **Windows path installs no `sqlite3` CLI** unlike the macOS/Linux paths — "a real gap since the quest's SQL snippets presumably need a sqlite3 client."

### 2. The Editor's Eye — 84 (pass) · ran 4, 3 passed / 1 failed / 1 skipped / 1 reasoned
- **`passed`** — Chapter 1 diff-collection: "ran it in a real git repo with an origin remote and a feature branch — `git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD`" behaved as documented.
- **`passed`** — Smuggle guard: "ran against a simulated PR that added `scripts/build.js` alongside a content edit: guard correctly detected and blocked it ('Content PR is smuggling infrastructure changes: scripts/build.js'). Ran again against a clean content-only PR: guard passed."
- **`passed`** — SLAIN loop-breaker: `git log -1 --format='%an'` vs `content-review[bot]` produced `skip=false` for a human commit and `skip=true` for a bot commit — correct.
- **`failed`** — 🐉 **BROKEN** boss example (lines ~196–211): "`with: { ref: ${{ github.head_ref }} }` fails to parse: PyYAML raises 'ParserError … expected "," or "}"'". The engine notes this is a *genuine YAML flow-style bug distinct from the intended lesson* (the self-retrigger loop) — an unintended second failure mode a copy-pasting learner would hit.
- **`skipped`** — `scripts/ai/run.sh content-reviewer` executed end-to-end but exited 1 on "Not logged in" (expected — no auth in sandbox); logic path validated.
- **`reasoned`** — Quest Network mermaid graph: valid `graph LR` syntax, static review only (no renderer).

### 3. The Bard Forge — 62 (warn) · ran 3, 1 passed / 2 failed / 1 reasoned
- **`passed`** — `bard-forge.yml` parsed with PyYAML; `on`/`if`/`permissions: contents: read` structure matches documented behavior (static, not triggered).
- **`failed`** — `scripts/mine_merge.sh "$PR_NUMBER"`: "happy path succeeds and emits correct `merge_metadata.json` … **However, the documented failure path is broken**: when gh returns empty SHAs, the … [diffstat computation crashes before the friendly guard fires]."
- **`failed`** — 'Open proposal PR' step: "(1) `git commit` in the freshly cloned target repo fails with 'Please tell me who you are' because no git identity is configured …; (2) `cp quest.md target/proposed/…` fails because that directory is never created."
- **`reasoned`** — quest-network mermaid: valid syntax; actual render attempted via `npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` but Chromium/Puppeteer couldn't launch in the sandbox (environment, not diagram).

### 4. The Agent Pantheon — 48 (fail) · ran 5, 3 passed / 2 failed / 1 reasoned
- **`passed`** — `_data/agents.yml`: "parsed cleanly, 3 agents with correctly typed fields."
- **`passed`** — `PROVISIONING.md` and `DECOMMISSION.md`: well-formed markdown, internally consistent with the registry schema.
- **`failed`** — `.github/workflows/agent-health-monitor.yml`: "the artifact `name:` field contains literal, unstripped Jekyll tags `{% raw %}{{ github.run_id }}{% endraw %}` instead of a working `${{ github.run_id }}` expression, and the workflow's two `run:` steps invoke `work/gh-600/scripts/load_registry.py` and `agent_health_check.py`" — scripts that exist nowhere in the quest.
- **`failed`** — `python3 scripts/validate_quest.py --quest q17`: ran the exact documented command → `can't open file '…/scripts/validate_quest.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory`, exit 2. The validation command as printed cannot succeed standalone.
- **`reasoned`** — quest-network mermaid: structurally valid, static review.

### 5. The Autonomy Scales — 59 (fail) · ran 4, 2 passed / 2 failed / 1 reasoned
- **`passed`** — Quest-network mermaid (`Q17 --> Q18 --> Q19`): "Rendered successfully with `npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` … produced valid SVG output."
- **`passed`** — `_data/autonomy-matrix.yml`: "parsed cleanly, all 5 task_classifications entries present."
- **`failed`** — `.github/workflows/feature-agent-l2.yml`: "the embedded shell contains leaked Jekyll tags `${% raw %}{{ github.event.issue.number }}{% endraw %}`; running that exact string in bash gives `bad substitution`" — plus a `\n` that renders as literal backslash-n in a `gh pr create --body`.
- **`failed`** — `python3 scripts/validate_quest.py --quest q18`: `can't open file '…/scripts/validate_quest.py'` — same missing-script defect as quest 4.
- **`reasoned`** — `review_autonomy_compliance.sh`: `bash -n` passed; full run needs `gh auth login` + a workflow named `agent-task.yml` that no prior step creates (it was named `feature-agent-l2.yml`), so it errored on auth as expected.

## 🐞 Issues Found

Every issue below is backed by a command the engine ran or an exact line it quoted. These are for a downstream content pass (content-curator / human) — I did **not** edit any quest.

1. **medium · The Editor's Eye · Boss Fight 🐉 BROKEN example (lines ~196–211)** — Observed: `with: { ref: ${{ github.head_ref }} }` fails PyYAML parse ("expected ',' or '}'"). This is an *unintended* second failure mode on top of the intended self-retrigger lesson, so a learner copying it literally hits a confusing YAML error, not the loop. **Fix:** use block style (`with:\n  ref: ${{ github.head_ref }}`) or quote the expression, matching every other block in the quest.
2. **high · The Bard Forge · `scripts/mine_merge.sh` error handling** — Observed: with empty SHAs the diffstat computation crashes before the friendly "Refusing to proceed" guard fires. **Fix:** move the `if [[ -z "$HEAD_SHA" || -z "$MERGE_SHA" ]]` check to immediately after the two `gh pr view` calls.
3. **high · The Bard Forge · 'Open proposal PR' workflow step** — Observed: (a) `git commit` fails "Please tell me who you are" (no git identity set after `gh repo clone`); (b) `cp … target/proposed/` fails — dir never created. **Fix:** add `git config user.email/user.name` in the cloned target repo and `mkdir -p target/proposed` before the `cp`.
4. **high · The Agent Pantheon · Chapter 2 `agent-health-monitor.yml`** — Observed: literal `{% raw %}{{ github.run_id }}{% endraw %}` leaked into the artifact `name:`; and two `run:` steps call `work/gh-600/scripts/load_registry.py` / `agent_health_check.py` that exist nowhere. **Fix:** strip the raw tags (wrap the fence in a site-level `{% raw %}` block) and either ship the two scripts as quest exercises or link where they live.
5. **high · The Autonomy Scales · Chapter 3 `feature-agent-l2.yml`** — Observed: `${% raw %}{{ github.event.issue.number }}{% endraw %}` → bash `bad substitution` when run verbatim, plus a `\n` that renders literally in `gh pr create --body`. **Fix:** wrap the whole fence in one site-level `{% raw %}`; use `$'…'`/heredoc for the newline.
6. **high · The Agent Pantheon & The Autonomy Scales · Quest Validation sections** — Observed (both quests): `python3 scripts/validate_quest.py --quest q17`/`--quest q18` → `No such file or directory`, exit 2. The script is never created by any quest step. **Fix (shared):** either ship/scaffold `validate_quest.py` or caveat that it is shared platform tooling requiring the full IT-Journey clone. This is one root cause across two quests — fix once.
7. **medium · The Autonomy Scales · Chapter 4 `review_autonomy_compliance.sh`** — Observed: passes `bash -n` but targets `--workflow=agent-task.yml`, a name never created (Chapter 3 makes `feature-agent-l2.yml`). **Fix:** align the workflow name or state the assumed pre-existing production workflow.
8. **medium · Data Warehousing · Chapter 2 star-schema snippets** — Observed: the "revenue by city by quarter" payoff query returns an empty set run verbatim because no sample data is ever inserted; it only produced 3 rows after the engine added its own INSERTs. **Fix:** add a small INSERT seed block before the aggregate query so the Novice Challenge validation shows real output.
9. **medium · Data Warehousing · Windows Empire Path** — Observed: the Windows/winget setup installs Python + DuckDB but **no `sqlite3` CLI**, unlike the macOS/Linux paths, while the quest's SQL snippets assume a `sqlite3` client. **Fix:** add a `sqlite3` acquisition step (or route Windows learners through DuckDB/`python -m sqlite3`) to the Windows path.

## 🔗 Chain Continuity

Reading all five in plan order as one learner, the biggest finding is structural, not per-quest:

- **This window is a level cross-section, not a single linked path.** The five quests belong to **three unrelated series**: `data-warehousing` → *Data Engineering Mastery* (the actual Data Scientist line); `self-operating-website-06/10` → *The Self-Operating Website*; `agentic-multi-agent-lifecycle-management`/`agentic-autonomy-levels-matrix` → *agentic-ai gh-600*. They share only the `1100` level code. A learner walking them top-to-bottom would experience three context switches (SQL/dimensional modeling → GitHub Actions content review → multi-agent governance) with no narrative bridge. This is expected for a rotating windowed sweep of a whole level, but it means "continuity" must be judged *within* series, not across the window.
- **Within the agentic pair, the dependency edge is real and correct.** `agentic-multi-agent-lifecycle-management` (Q17) declares `unlocks: agentic-autonomy-levels-matrix` (Q18), and Q18 declares Q17 as `required` — a genuine, correctly-wired edge, and both are in this window in the right order. **But both inherit the same two systemic defects** (leaked `{% raw %}` templating + missing `scripts/validate_quest.py`), so a learner who hits the wall on Q17's validation will hit the identical wall on Q18. Fixing the shared root cause repairs the pair together.
- **The Self-Operating chapters are non-adjacent and their prerequisites are outside the window.** Chapter 6 (Editor's Eye) requires Chapter 5 (*The Content Forge*, level 1010) — "without a draft-producing pipeline, there is nothing to edit"; Chapter 10 (Bard Forge) requires Chapter 9 (*The Chronicle*, level 1110) whose published retrospective is "the spark this chapter listens for." Neither prerequisite is in this slice (they live at 1010/1110), so a learner arriving cold at these two chapters lacks the upstream pipeline they assume. Each quest *does* flag its prior chapter in prose, which softens the gap, but the window cannot stand alone as a runnable journey for these two.
- **Data Warehousing is the one quest that stands cleanly on its own** and is the natural "home" quest for the Data Scientist at this level — self-contained setup, prerequisites (`etl-pipeline-design`) declared, all SQL executable. It is the strongest anchor of the window.

Net: **within-series continuity is sound where both endpoints are present (the agentic pair); cross-series continuity is absent by construction; and the two Self-Operating chapters assume out-of-window upstream state.** No prerequisite *contradiction* was found — the gaps are "prerequisite lives elsewhere," which is correct given the windowed sweep.

## 🧠 Reasoning & Method

- **Mode:** `execute` — the workflow pre-computed and **sealed** `walk-evidence.json` / `walk-evidence.md` with the deterministic agentic execute engine (avg 66.6%, 2 pass · 1 warn · 2 fail, ~$3.38, per-quest sessions 172–286 s). Per the skill's step 2, I consumed that evidence **as-is** and did **not** re-run the engine (its child `claude` processes can't authenticate from my Bash tool) and did **not** edit the plan or evidence files.
- **What I ran vs. reasoned:** The engine ran the sandboxed commands (SQL DDL/queries in SQLite 3.45.1 + DuckDB 1.5.5, git diff/smuggle-guard/loop-breaker shell, YAML parses via PyYAML, mermaid renders via mermaid-cli, the two `validate_quest.py` invocations). **I** independently read all five quest sources in plan order and reasoned about the linked journey, prerequisites, and cross-series structure (§Chain Continuity) — that layer is my analysis, grounded in the quoted frontmatter `quest_dependencies` and the engine's command outcomes. Every `passed`/`failed` in §Evidence traces to a command the engine actually ran; items I judged statically are labelled `reasoned`.
- **Coverage caps & limits:** This is **window 1 of 3** of a 15-quest level — I walked **5 quests**; the other 10 (windows 2–3) are not covered by this session and the ledger accumulates them over subsequent runs. Sandbox limits the engine flagged honestly: no macOS/Windows (setup paths for those OSes `reasoned` only, not executed), no network to verify winget package IDs, no auth (so `run.sh` and `gh`-dependent steps exited on login prompts as expected), and Puppeteer/Chromium couldn't launch for one mermaid render (Bard Forge). None of these environment limits were reported as quest defects.
- **Overall verdict rationale:** `warn`. The window is walkable and conceptually sound throughout, and its foundational data-engineering quest is strong — but **2 of 5 quests fail the rubric floor** on runnable-command fidelity and one warns, driven mostly by two shared, mechanical root causes (leaked `{% raw %}` templating + a missing shared validation script). These are high-confidence, reproducible, and fixable without rewrites. I did not upgrade to `pass` (multiple failing quests) nor down to `fail` overall (the slice still teaches correctly and half of it is clean).
- **Confidence:** High on the per-quest defects (each is a concrete command result or a quoted line). High on the structural continuity finding (grounded in declared `quest_dependencies`). Medium on the OS-specific setup gaps for macOS/Windows, which were `reasoned`, not executed.

*One slice, one report. No quest content was modified; git is handled by the caller.*
