## 🎯 Session Summary

I walked the first window (5 of 9) of the **System Engineer → Level 1001** slice as a
learner, in the order the planner selected. The level's theme is "Kubernetes
Orchestration," but the window is really **two different arcs stapled together**: four
GH-600 "Agentic Codex" quests about AI agents, and one standalone Kubernetes
fundamentals quest. The engine ran every runnable snippet in a disposable sandbox.

The headline is a sharp **quality bifurcation**. The two *anchor* quests —
**Vaults of Recollection: Memory & State** (94) and **Kubernetes Fundamentals** (97)
— are excellent: their hands-on labs were executed end-to-end and matched the
documented output byte-for-byte. But the three GH-600 "Q6→Q7→Q8" hands-on quests
(**Dev Environment Integration** 50, **Safe Execution & Error Handling** 43, **Agent
Memory Strategies** 48) all **fail on launch-blocking defects in their centerpiece
code**, and they fail in the *same three recurring ways* — a strong signal these were
authored from a shared broken template. Overall verdict: **fail** (3 of 5 quests
have defects a "Hard"-rated learner would hit on the first copy-paste). Average
66.4%.

## 🗺️ The Journey

Plan order (as selected by `walk-plan.json`), with per-quest score and takeaway:

1. ✅ **Vaults of Recollection: Memory & State** — `94` · The whole 6-step Hands-On
   Lab ran and matched every "Expected:" block exactly; only real defect is the
   Chapter-3 `drift-guard.sh` crashing on a missing `_config.yml` (a failure the
   quest itself discloses and then corrects in the lab).
2. ❌ **Bind the Agent to the Realm: Dev Environment Integration** — `50` · Sound
   concepts, but `check_agent_env.sh` guaranteed-crashes on its first check
   (`((PASS++))` under `set -e`), checks for a file the quest never creates, and the
   AGENTS.md block has broken nested code fences.
3. ❌ **The Shield of Retries: Safe Execution and Error Handling** — `43` · The
   Exercise 7.1 workflow fails to execute (leaked `{% raw %}{% raw %}{% endraw %}{% endraw %}` tags inside
   expressions), and the Exercise 7.3 test script is a non-functional stub with a
   mis-placed shebang.
4. ❌ **Vaults of Recollection: Agent Memory Strategies** — `48` · The flagship
   Exercise 8.1 workflow breaks two independent ways (indented heredoc terminator +
   leaked raw tags), and the validation command points at a script that doesn't exist.
5. ✅ **Kubernetes Fundamentals: Container Orchestration Essentials** — `97` · Every
   runnable snippet executed against a real `kind` cluster and matched reality,
   including the reconciliation-loop lesson and both failure repros
   (`ImagePullBackOff`, `CrashLoopBackOff`). Only minor clarity nits.

## 🔬 Evidence

All statuses below come from the sealed engine run (`--mode execute`,
`walk-evidence.json`); commands marked `reasoned` were judged statically by the engine
(not run). I did not re-run the engine — I read the four agentic quests in full and
reasoned over this evidence.

### 1. Memory & State (`agentic-codex-03…`) — 9 snippets, 8 passed / 1 failed
- ✅ Lab Steps 1–5 (git init → Tier-2 plan handoff → Tier-3 `task-register.jsonl`
  commit → drift-guard snapshot/verify → context-handoff freshness check) all ran and
  matched output. Step 4 reproduced the `exit=0` → `exit=78` drift transition and the
  `README.md: FAILED` / `WARNING` lines exactly as documented.
- ❌ `bash scripts/drift-guard.sh` (Chapter-3 version): `sha256sum: _config.yml: No
  such file or directory`, exits 1 under `set -euo pipefail` before reaching drift
  logic. The quest's own inline comment warns about this (`a missing file kills
  snapshot() under set -e`) and the lab supplies a corrected `WATCH` array — so the
  gap is **disclosed, not hidden**, but a learner running the pre-lab snippet verbatim
  still hits a crash.
- ✅ Dimensions: commands_work 4, content_accuracy 5, completeness 5, clarity 5,
  structure 5, safety 5.

### 2. Dev Environment Integration — 5 runnable snippets, 4 failed
- ❌ `markdown block — AGENTS.md content (Exercise 6.1)`: nested triple-backtick fences
  (` ```markdown ` / ` ```bash ` closers inside a ` ```markdown ` block) corrupt both
  the page rendering and any AGENTS.md copied from it. (Visible in source at lines
  162–196.)
- ❌ `check_agent_env.sh` definition + run: under `set -euo pipefail`, `((PASS++))`
  evaluates to 0 on the first success and returns exit 1, killing the script after the
  first check — reproduced by the engine.
- ❌ `python3 scripts/validate_quest.py --quest q6`: script does not exist; fails
  immediately in a learner's sandbox.
- ⏭️ Cold-start block skipped (network clone of placeholder `YOUR_ORG/YOUR_REPO`).
- ✅ `devcontainer.json` (Exercise 6.2) parsed clean.
- Dimensions: commands_work 1, content_accuracy 3, completeness 2, clarity 3,
  structure 4, safety 5.

### 3. Safe Execution & Error Handling — 5 runnable snippets, 3 failed
- ❌ `agent-with-retries.yml` (Exercise 7.1): inline `{% raw %}{% raw %}…{% endraw %}{% endraw %}` tags land
  *inside* the shell/JS expressions (e.g. `--issue "${…{{ github.event.issue.number }}…}"`),
  so the extracted bash step fails with "bad substitution" and the github-script step
  throws a SyntaxError.
- ❌ `test_failure_scenarios.sh` (Exercise 7.3): `#!/usr/bin/env bash` is on line 2
  (after a path comment), and the body is comment-only stubs — the exercise's stated
  objective ("Test failure recovery") is never actually delivered.
- ❌ `python3 scripts/validate_quest.py --quest q7`: missing script.
- ✅ Exercise 7.2 label-step fragment and the Chapter-5 error-report JSON both valid.
- Dimensions: commands_work 1, content_accuracy 2, completeness 2, clarity 3,
  structure 4, safety 4.

### 4. Agent Memory Strategies — 4 runnable snippets, 2 failed
- ❌ `agent-with-session-memory.yml` (Exercise 8.1): the `cat > … << 'EOF'` and
  `python3 - << 'EOF'` heredocs have **indented** closing `EOF` delimiters, so plain
  `<<` (not `<<-`) throws a bash syntax error; and the same inline `{% raw %}{% raw %}{% endraw %}{% endraw %}`
  leak corrupts every Actions expression in the cache keys and artifact names.
- ❌ `python3 scripts/validate_quest.py --quest q8`: missing script.
- ✅ Exercise 8.2 (`mkdir docs/agent-memory` + `touch`) and the Chapter-4
  `learned-patterns.md` example both ran / parsed fine.
- Dimensions: commands_work 1, content_accuracy 2, completeness 3, clarity 3,
  structure 4, safety 5.

### 5. Kubernetes Fundamentals — 10 runnable snippets, all passed
- ✅ Linux install + `kind create cluster --name citadel`, `kubectl get nodes -o
  wide`, `hello-pod.yaml` apply, `kubectl get pods --watch`, `describe`, `logs`,
  imperative-vs-declarative, namespace `dojo`, and the self-healing `kubectl delete
  pod` lesson all executed against a real cluster and matched documented behavior.
- ✅ Both failure-state repros (`ImagePullBackOff`, `CrashLoopBackOff`) reproduced.
- ⏭️/💭 macOS + Windows install blocks reasoned (OS-specific, not run on the Linux
  sandbox) — acceptable, they're clearly labeled alternatives.
- Dimensions: commands_work 5, content_accuracy 5, completeness 5, clarity 4,
  structure 5, safety 5.

## 🐞 Issues Found

There **are** blocking issues. Grouped by the systemic pattern first, since the three
failing quests share defects.

**SYSTEMIC — the GH-600 "Q6→Q7→Q8" trio was authored from a shared broken pattern:**

- **high · Dev Env / Safe Exec / Memory Strategies · "✅ Quest Validation" blocks ·**
  All three end with `python3 scripts/validate_quest.py --quest q6|q7|q8`, presented
  as a runnable command with faked ✅ output. The script does not exist — every learner
  who runs it gets `No such file or directory`. *Fix:* ship/link the script, or clearly
  relabel these as platform-side CI checks / sample output, not local commands.

- **high · Safe Exec (7.1) & Memory Strategies (8.1) · leaked Liquid tags inside code
  fences ·** `{% raw %}{% raw %}…{% endraw %}{% endraw %}` is placed *inline within* Actions expressions
  rather than wrapping the whole fenced block. The engine (which reads raw `.md`)
  extracted literal tags and the code failed to execute. *Nuance I reasoned about:*
  on the *rendered* site Jekyll strips these tags, so a learner copying from the
  published page likely sees correct `${{ … }}`; but any agent/tool reading the repo
  source (and, ironically, these are agent quests) hits the literal tags. The clean
  fix already exists in this very slice — **Memory & State** wraps `{% raw %}{% raw %}{% endraw %}{% endraw %}`
  *outside* the fence, so its extracted YAML is clean. *Fix:* wrap raw tags at the
  block level like the codex chapter does, and never split an expression across a
  raw/endraw boundary.

**Per-quest defects:**

- **high · Dev Env · Exercise 6.3 `check_agent_env.sh` ·** `((PASS++))` / `((FAIL++))`
  under `set -euo pipefail` returns exit 1 the first time the counter goes 0→1,
  killing the script after the first check (engine-reproduced). *Fix:*
  `PASS=$((PASS+1))` / `FAIL=$((FAIL+1))`.
- **high · Dev Env · Exercise 6.3 ·** the script checks for
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, a file the quest never tells the learner to
  create — so even after the `set -e` fix it fails with no prior guidance. *Fix:* add a
  step that creates it, or drop the check.
- **high · Dev Env · Exercise 6.1 AGENTS.md block ·** nested code fences (` ```markdown `
  containing ` ```bash `/` ```markdown ` closers) break rendering and any produced
  AGENTS.md. *Fix:* use a 4-backtick outer fence or de-nest the Test/Build examples.
- **high · Memory Strategies · Exercise 8.1 heredocs ·** indented closing `EOF`
  with plain `<<` → bash syntax error at run time. *Fix:* left-align the `EOF`
  terminators (column 0) or use `<<-'EOF'` with tabs.
- **high · Safe Exec · Exercise 7.3 `test_failure_scenarios.sh` ·** shebang on line 2 +
  comment-only stubs; delivers none of the promised failure-recovery testing. *Fix:*
  move `#!/usr/bin/env bash` to line 1 and implement real mocks/assertions.
- **medium · Memory & State · Chapter 3 `drift-guard.sh` ·** crashes on missing
  `_config.yml` under `set -e` before reaching drift logic. It's disclosed inline and
  fixed in the lab, so it's not launch-blocking — but the *first* appearance of the
  script is the broken one. *Fix:* make the Chapter-3 snippet guard missing files
  (`[ -f "$f" ]`) so the teaching version can't crash before the lab corrects it.
- **low · Dev Env · Node 18 references ·** EOL since April 2025; bump to current LTS.
- **low · Kubernetes Fundamentals ·** minor clarity nits only (unbounded `--watch`, a
  TTY caveat for `exec`, the `Error`→`CrashLoopBackOff` status flicker). Non-blocking.

## 🔗 Chain Continuity

Reading these as one journey a System Engineer would actually take surfaced three
structural observations the isolated per-quest scores don't:

1. **The level theme doesn't match most of the window.** Level 1001 is labeled
   "Kubernetes Orchestration / Warrior," yet 4 of the 5 quests here are GH-600 Agentic
   AI content (`quest_line: gh-600`, `quest_series: agentic-ai-mastery` / "The Agentic
   Codex"). Only **Kubernetes Fundamentals** (`quest_line: The Warrior's Orchestration
   Citadel`) belongs to the stated theme. A learner arriving for "Kubernetes" would be
   confused to land in AI-agent workflow tutorials. The two arcs also have **separate,
   non-intersecting dependency graphs**, so this isn't really one linked path — it's
   two paths co-located by binary level.

2. **Two quests carry the same "Vaults of Recollection" title and teach the same
   three-tier memory model** — the codex chapter (`agentic-codex-03…`, 94) and the
   GH-600 quest (`agentic-memory-strategies`, 48). The chapter is the well-authored
   version; the quest is the broken one, yet the quest is what the Q6→Q7→Q8 dependency
   chain routes learners through. A learner who reads the polished chapter first and
   then hits the broken 8.1 workflow will (rightly) trust the chapter and distrust the
   quest. Consolidating or cross-linking these would reduce the whiplash.

3. **The real GH-600 chain (Q6 → Q7 → Q8) is dependency-correct but uniformly
   broken at the hands-on layer.** `agentic-dev-environment-integration` →
   `agentic-safe-execution-and-error-handling` → `agentic-memory-strategies` link
   cleanly via `quest_dependencies`, and each *concept* section leaves the learner
   ready for the next. But all three share the missing `validate_quest.py` "victory"
   command and the leaked-Liquid / bash-gotcha pattern, so a learner completing the
   chain never actually gets a green validation and never runs working centerpiece
   code. Prerequisite-wise the chain also assumes `/quests/1000/agentic-mcp-server-mastery`
   (outside this window) — not walked here, flagged as an out-of-slice dependency.

Positive continuity note: **Kubernetes Fundamentals** stands on its own cleanly
(`required_quests: []`, recommends 1000-level cloud fundamentals, unlocks a coherent
1001 Kubernetes track: `k8s-pods-workloads`, `k8s-services-networking`,
`k8s-config-secrets`). It is the one quest in this window that fully delivers what a
System Engineer at this tier expects.

## 🧠 Reasoning & Method

- **Mode:** `execute`, in the disposable runner sandbox. I did **not** run the engine
  myself — per the workflow contract the evidence (`walk-evidence.json` /
  `walk-evidence.md`) was pre-computed and sealed by a deterministic step, and I
  consumed it as-is. I did not modify the plan or evidence.
- **What I ran vs. reasoned:** every `passed`/`failed`/`skipped` above is an engine
  command actually executed (or skipped) in the sandbox; every `reasoned` item was
  judged statically by the engine. My own contribution was the **linked-journey
  reasoning** in Chain Continuity, derived from reading the four agentic quests in
  full and the Kubernetes quest's frontmatter, cross-referenced against the sealed
  command results — I did not invent any output or score.
- **Coverage / limits:**
  - Window only: **5 of 9** quests in the level (window 1 of 2). The other 4 quests
    of Level 1001 are out of scope for this run and unassessed here.
  - The Kubernetes quest's **macOS/Windows install blocks were reasoned, not run**
    (Linux sandbox) — acceptable, they're labeled OS alternatives.
  - The Dev Env **cold-start block was skipped** (it clones a placeholder repo over
    the network) — correctly not attempted in-sandbox.
  - One **out-of-slice prerequisite** (`/quests/1000/agentic-mcp-server-mastery`) is
    assumed by the GH-600 chain and was not walked.
  - The leaked-Liquid-tag issue carries a **source-vs-rendered nuance** I stated
    explicitly rather than overclaiming: the engine tests raw `.md`, so on the live
    rendered page the tags are stripped; the defects that survive rendering are the
    heredoc indentation, the `((PASS++))` bug, the nested fences, and the missing
    `validate_quest.py`.
- **Confidence:** High on the per-quest defects (each reproduced by an executed
  command). High on the theme-mismatch and duplicate-title continuity findings (from
  frontmatter I read directly). Medium on the precise learner impact of the Liquid-tag
  leak, given the rendered-page nuance above.
